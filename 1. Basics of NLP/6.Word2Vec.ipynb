As this is a fairly new place some of the taxi drivers did not know where it was and/or did not want to drive there. Once I have eventually arrived at the hotel, I was very pleasantly surprised with the decor of the lobby/ground floor area. It was very stylish and modern. I found the reception's staff geeting me with 'Aloha' a bit out of place, but I guess they are briefed to say that to keep up the coroporate image.As I have a Starwood Preferred Guest member, I was given a small gift upon-check in. It was only a couple of fridge magnets in a gift box, but nevertheless a nice gesture.My room was nice and roomy, there are tea and coffee facilities in each room and you get two complimentary bottles of water plus some toiletries by 'bliss'.The location is not great. It is at the last metro stop and you then need to take a taxi, but if you are not planning on going to see the historic sites in Beijing, then you will be ok.I chose to have some breakfast in the hotel, which was really tasty and there was a good selection of dishes. There are a couple of computers to use in the communal area, as well as a pool table. There is also a small swimming pool and a gym area.I would definitely stay in this hotel again, but only if I did not plan to travel to central Beijing, as it can take a long time. The location is ok if you plan to do a lot of shopping, as there is a big shopping centre just few minutes away from the hotel and there are plenty of eating options around, including restaurants that serve a dog meat!\t\n",
    "Sep 25 2009 \tGreat Budget Hotel!\tStayed two nights at Aloft on the most recent trip to China. The hotel was very modern and clean. The room was spotless and a comfortable king sized bed (as far as soft beds go in China). The staff was very punctual and went out of the way to help my every need, including going to a store across the street to purchase a China Mobile SIM card for me. The buffet breakfast was okay, nothing to write home about. The 42” LCD screen had movies on demand for 20RMB and had a good selection of western channels including HBO, CNN, BBC, Star World etc… The gym was small, had a selection of basic weights and one cable machine, there was however 6 new TechnoGym cardio machines with built in LCD TVs which were very good. The location is a bit out of the way to the central areas of Beijing, but it is better suited for my needs as I need to be in the Haidian district. Being SPG Platinum there were no upgrades to a better room, because Aloft has a policy of not doing any upgrades. The Sheraton next door is a much nicer hotel in my opinion (where I am writing this from now, with an upgraded room) but as far as bang for the buck, Aloft is a great place!\t\n",
    "Aug 4 2009 \tExcellent value - location not a big problem.\tWe stayed at the Aloft Beijing Haidian for 5 nights from July 17 - 22nd. There are lots of reviews that talk about the location being a problem but we knew this ahead of time and found that it really wasn't an issue. The longest we spent in a taxi was about 30 minutes. We never paid more than 50rmb for a taxi ride (which is about $8 Cdn) and that was to the Forbidden City. Given there are 4 in our family, it was no big deal at all.As for the rooms, they were clean, the beds comfortable, the wireless internet connection reliable and it was one of the few hotels we found in Beijing that would accomodate 2 adults and 2 children. We paid about $70 Cdn. per night. That's an amazing price.It's not meant to be a 5 star hotel so you can't go in expecting that. We found the reception staff generally very helpful and friendly. They aren't the fastest in the world but it wasn't unreasonable at all.The hotel manager made an effort to speak with us a few times and was extremely helpful and welcoming. Their breakfast buffet was quite good and reasonably priced. There are a number of good restaurants in the Four Points Sheraton next door so there were lots of options. There is a massive mall about a block away that has other dining options as well.The only issue we ran into was a few taxi drivers refusing to take us to the Summer Palace because I guess they felt it wasn't far enough. The minimum rate is 10rmb. But the staff at the Four Points Sheraton (which is on a busier road than the side street for Aloft) were quite helpful in finding taxis for us if they weren't already there.We would definitely stay there again and recommend it to our friends for its excellent value.\t\n",
    "Jul 17 2009 \tStylish clean reasonable value poor location\tI am glad to be the first person to post photos of this hotel. Key points about this property:- its a starwood property, much cheaper than the rest, and it shows in the pretty incompetent reception staff, the hard bed, the cheap blinds that don't quite block out the sun in the mornings, and common areas which seem to be degrading very quickly (given how new this hotel is).- on the up side, it is very clean and tidy, and if that is important to you, this hotel presents good value. It is also quite stylishly designed and looks much more modern than anything else in this price range.- location is poor for the typical tourist. Yes, very poor. It is not really close to much cheaper the summer palace, and other places will require a taxi, which will probably result in hours of being frustratingly stuck in traffic. Taxi drivers also dont know where it is. If coming from the East, (i.e. city centre or airport) then it is the right turn AFTER the Four Points hotel, which is adjacent. If you are trying to scam an SPG platinum status in the cheapest way possible, perhaps stay in these two adjacent SPG hotels for 25 nights and check out every night.On the whole I thought it was decent value, but dollar for dollar, I would personally prefer to pay double for the Westin in Chaoyang or Financial Street. I have stayed at both at approx. double the price, for real 5 star service. But if thats not in your budget and you want the assurance of an international hotel chain, this hotel is perfect for you.Lastly, this hotel may also be appropriate for university students in Haidian, but don't pick this unless you know what you are doing. Taxis to BLCU or Tsing Hua may be exceptionally frustrating because of constant traffic around Zhong guan cun street. Tell taxi drivers to go on the four ring road, even though it might be a bit more expensive.There is free internet, but it does not seem to work with iPhones.\t\n",
    "May 30 2009 \tRemote but excellent value for money\tStayed there for one night. The hotel is located in Haidian, which is a little bit remote. But if you don't mind taking the taxi to the closest subway station, which costs only 15-20 CNY a ride the hotel represents excellent value for money given its low prices and the modern, quiet and very clean rooms. Also internet use is for free. Especially for travellors who don't want to spend the money for a Hyatt or Hilton but who look for a very decent place to stay this hotel represents an excellent choice.\t\n",
    "Dec 31 2008 \tGood value but not downtown\tThis hotel is located next to the Four Points Hotel and are both part of the Starwood group. For those wanting a downtown location, this property may not be for you - I recommend factoring in taxi fares in and out of town when working out the value here. On the otherside, the rates for the hotel are very good and the rooms are basic but well appointed. TV was more focused on local channels which may be an indication of the clients they are targeting. There was however the standard HBO, BBC, etc. Staff were very friendly and check in and check out times were acceptable.\t\n",
    "Jul 20 2009 \t???????????????????\t\t\n",
    "Nov 17 2009 \tgreat room layout service value-would definitely return\twe stayed in a 3 bedroomed-suite which was well furnished and the staff perfect hosts. they even organised a birthday cake for my Mum (we were all there to celebrate).could organise for massages / manicures in our suite, perfect for relaxing.located in the CBD so not great for tourists but plenty of remarkably good valued restaurants nearby.\t\n",
    "Nov 7 2009 \tA quality hotel with quality service\tWe stayed at the Ascott Beijing this summer for 1 week in a family of 5. It is centrally located. When you are a european with kids staying for a few days it is ideal to have a fully equipped kitchen and a big Wal-Mart nearby. We had a modern and spacious apartment with a big LCD flat television. The service was really good and important for us not speaking the language: we never had to wait for a taxi and they always provided info for our directions.We would definitely return!\t\n",
    "Oct 16 2009 \tclean rooms good location poor service\tcheck-in:my friends are i arrived from different countries @ different times and were greeted in the same lousy way. the bellboy did not help with luggage. the doorman did not open door. and the receptionist took more than 5 minutes to greet us with no smile despite having no other guest in the lobby. in sum, not pleasant.room:we had the 2 bedroom suite. very spacious and comfy with all basic amenities. bathroom was spacious with separate bathtub and shower area equipped with l'occitaine toiletries. but they do not provide us with new ones even tho we have finished them. we had to ask the receptionist/concierge TWICE before getting more toiletries to shower. the washing machine is brilliant, but the 4 of us were not clever enough to work out how to wash and dry the 4 days we were there. Ended up doing the laundry by hand. location:central and within walking distance to the train station and food places. slight difficulty getting a taxi tho. 7eleven is just round the corner. and there's a starbucks on the ground floor.breakfast:small but good spread with standard egg station, fruits, breads and some local congee and hot food.massage/spa:we had massage and Chinese pedicure there. pedicurist is a man who told us how maggie cheung went there for a massage a while ago. quality of massage and pedicure was average.\t\n",
    "Sep 18 2009 \tAmazing find for a group that wants to stick together\tWe did a lot of searching before finally deciding to stay at the Ascott in Beijing. I was a bit nervous since it would be my first trip to China and I know little about the best place to stay. This ended up being the perfect choice. We had 7 people traveling together and booked the 3 room suite/apartment. We comfortable slept everyone. The 2.5 bathrooms worked well for our group. We also loved having a kitchen to be able to have a little choice about what we ate. We wish there would have been a grocery store closer by, although we made good use of the 7 eleven across the street. The in-room washer and dryer were also definitely a plus and there was plenty of space for lounging around.Some have complained about the internet. As far as wireless goes you can pick some up, but I wouldn't count on it. We did have 2 wired connections though so we just shared them and made do. We weren't in China for the internet anyway so we didn't care too much.The hotel staff went above and beyond to accommodate us. I left my passport in the taxi upon arrival and the moment I told them they got right on top of tracking it down for me.For added convenience there is also a Subway restaurant attached to the hotel. This may sound silly to most people, but after 2 weeks in china I was ready to put something a bit more familiar to me in my stomach and that hit the spot. Across the street you can find a Chinese food restaurant that will deliver to your hotel room. We had breakfast included in our stay which was a great way to start each morning.The hotel is less than a 5 minute walk to the subway entrance and maybe a 10-15 minute walk to the silk market and other nearby sights. All in all the hotel was very clean and the service was great. It is a wonderful deal for how nice the accommodations are and I would highly recommend it to anyone.\t\n",
    "Sep 5 2009 \tGood Value for large family - Internet connection prob not hotel's fault\tGreat for large families! We grabbed a large 3 bedroom for 6 adults and 2 kids. Great room - my chinese inlaws really liked the kitchen and washer/dryer. Big thumbs up from them. Large LCD tv was also in heavy rotation. Had a nice kids movie with popcorn and the works every Friday. Internet was down for several days (the hotel's guest room ISP had an issue), however the GM allowed us use of the conference center internet which was a different ISP as soon as he was aware. Prob solved. If you are looking for Casa Mia, it closed, however Annie's Italian is opening soon right across the street. I've never tried Casa Mia but Annie's is a great chain with excellent service, good value, great food. Also tried the subway and curry rest in the building all fine. Gym facilities were awesome - full Cybex, freeweights and treadmills with LCDs. The breakfast buffet actually improved during our stay, and we were asked for ideas to make it better. The kids room is more oriented towards toddlers - small ball pit and other basic toys. 5 and 8 yo with us enjoyed the pool more - decent temps and very clean. If you stay here, learn how to get to Walmart, its faster to walk than taxi, and they have all of the essentials at good prices. Everybody bought a lot of our local food souveniers there. The main lacking of this hotel is that it's not a tourist hotel. You'll have to do most of the homework on your own. Find a local guide and hire them like we did.\t\n",
    "Aug 17 2009\tdon't rely on it if you have any mission-critical deals to seal\tthe internet connection was not reliable at all. I was not able to connect to my US stock/futures broker to view/trade the markets. couldn't login to my airline to do an internet check in or book my seat. Other websites such as yahoo, msn messenger service were inacessible as well. the front desk tried it as well and they have no clue and no answer how to fix it. the 2 bed rooms were generally big and well equipped. had a dryer/washing machine,safe with no instructions, TV in the living room was an LCD, TV in the room was a grainy CRT Breakfast was lousy. Spread was limited and tilted towards awfuloverall - a horrible experience. Internet connection should be as essential water in the toilet . if like me you need a steady and reliable connection, avoid this place.\t\n",
    "Aug 15 2009 \tBest place in Beijing\tI travel a lot in Beijing, I've stayed in different hotel and serviced apartment and honestly this one is the best one I ever stayed. The staff is always friendly and try there best to satisfied each of your request.There is a Starbucks, a minimart and several restaurant in house, each of them can deliver food in your apartment. There is also a massage center, you can phone them and order a massage in your room.The room are just awesome, you will have more place that you never had in any hotel or even serviced apartment, the smallest room is around 100 square meter, I always stay in a 2 bedroom around 200 square meter and I always feel like at home away from home.The staff and the management are really helpfull, I really apreciate the way guest are treated.Of course I recommend this residence for family our group, but it will be suitable for people who like space and great facilities.\t\n",
    "Aug 7 2009 \tWe loved it!\tWe stayed at the Ascott for 4 nights, and were extremely happy with the facilities and rooms. The apartment was very large and spacious for our family of 4 and is perfect for families or 2 couples as there are 2 bedrooms (1 with a king bed, the other with a double or queen) and 2 well equipped bathrooms. The kitchen had all the utensils and dishes you needed. We did not cook but bought groceries and had breakfast and snacks at the hotel. There was even a washer and they provided packets of soap. We used the gorgeous pool area everday and there is also a steamroom and sauna. We were on a private tour so we didn't venture out of the hotel on our own but we always seemed to be about 20 minutes from the main attractions in Beijing. There is a Subway and bank machine right in the hotel. We'd recommed this hotel to anyone!\t\n",
    "Jul 21 2009 \tNice apartment\tStayed for 4 nights in a 2 bedroom. It's a home away from home. Nice apartment except for the laundry problem mentioned in the previous post. After waiting 3 hours for the first load, I learned my lesson. Don't want to spend my vacation time doing laundry, you know. Since it's a small capacity washer and dryer (loads about 12 pieces of clothing), I just selected what needs to be washed and choose the shortest wash time with about 60 minutes of drying time. That way clothes are dry not damp. do be aware that your white clothes may be stained with yellow stains, probably from the water. At least that's what my Beijing friends told me. Location wise, it's a liitle farther from most of the sights. As far as taxi drivers unable to find the location of this apartment, I think it's a common problem for travellers to Beijing. I think the taxi drivers in Beijing are notorious at overcharging visitors. I've paid between rmb15 to rmb70 on different occasions travelling from Ascott to wangfujing street and vice versa. taxi drivers in Beijing are not trustworthy. From my own experience, I can tell that it's a trick for the drivers to tell the passengers that they are not familiar with a location and they would have to make phone calls to verify. Then, they would start cruising around while the charges keep going up. This happens to me about 8 out of 10 times I took a taxi anywhere. It's a huge problem and I speak their language. Imagine someone who doesn't. Overall, I would recommend this apartment to families only. there're better places to stay in Beijing if you are single or a couple.\t\n",
    "Jul 7 2009 \tAvoid it if you are planning to do your own laundry at this place\tStay here for 5 nights with my family after reading previous positive reviews on Trip Advisor, the Travel Channel (Beijing special with Samatha Brown), and friends. The only good thing I can say is the roominess of the place(we stayed in the 2 bedroom) and the fairly good value you get for your money. Otherwise I say avoid it! Services were extremely slow due to understaffing (I think on purposes by the management despite low cost of labor in Beijing). Waits of 30 minutes to an hour was the norm with each calls for housekeeping or repair crew to come by. CAN'T stand the poor quality of the combination washer/dryer unit inside the apartment. It takes at least 3-4 hours to do a load of laundry (wash &amp; dry) and the clothes still come out damp to wet. Have complaint to management a few times but best they can do is apologize. If you are planning to do sightseeing in Beijing (which we did for a few days), where do you even find time to spend this much time on doing laundry( and still get upset with the damp/wet cloths). Breakfast was very greasy for the Chinese items and Western breakfast items were few and skimpy. Would definitely NOT stay here again despite all the hype, location was not easy to find (taxi drivers had a hard time locating it, and had to call the hotel to get directions). Faucets on basins/tubs were hard to reach if you had to wash something (if you see them, you would know what I am talking about). AVOID!\t\n",
    "Jun 1 2009 \tGreat Value and excellent choice for family with children\tAlthough the Casa Mia Restaurant has closed, Ascott Beijing still serves well for families with children (since it's a serviced apt). It has a gym, a pool and a play room (for young children). The location is also quite central (next to Park Hyatt) - highly recommended for families!\t\n",
    "Apr 22 2009 \tIdeal for a family or a larger group\tI spent six nights in a 3 bedroom apartment at the Ascott with five of my family members.Pros: Fully equipped kitchen and laundry. Spacious living/dining area. Free internet access. Beautiful swimming pool/Jacuzzi. Sauna and steam. Spacious gym with new equipments. Well-situated - Currency exchange at the desk, mini-market/Citibank ATM/massage shop on the premises, good Chinese restaurant just across the street. For grocery shopping, 2 minute walk to a 7-11 convenience store, and about 15 minute walk to a Wal-mart. About 10 minute walk to the Guo Mao subway and bus station (Be careful when you cross the road). Taxis are available at the hotel entrance. Have your destinations printed in Chinese, when you take taxis.Cons: I have no complain but one. While the housekeepers were polite and seemed earnest, the service was not up to par with what I had expected. The master bedroom and bathroom were left unclean one day. The towels and amenities (shower gel, shampoo, bathroom glasses, toilet papers, and so on) were not enough; we only had four sets of towels for six people and had to keep asking for more during the first 2,3 days. But those were not a big deal for us anyway. Just keep in mind that this is a serviced apartment mainly for long-stay expats, not really a hotel.Overall, I think the Ascott is one of the best options for a family or larger group.\t\n",
    "Mar 25 2009\tExcellent hotel for a family\tThis hotel is perfect for a family staying in Beiijing. The rooms are like apartments - fully equipped kitchen and laundry. Spacious living/dining area. We stayed in a 2 bedroom suite. The rooms were large and bright. The room is cleaned daily. Overall, very clean except some carpet stains. The location of the hotel is not bad. It is located at Guo Mao, the CBD of Beijing. Convenient for business trips. However, do not be tricked by the fact that it appears close to Guo Mao Subway station. Although the hotel is situated practically on the Guo Mao Intersection (3rd Ring Road and Jian Guo Road), the subway station is not near. The Guo Mao intersection is absolutely massive - the subway station is across the road at the South-West corner while the hotel is at the South-East corner. To cross the road you must follow the crowd - Beijing drivers and pedestrians are absolutely crazy compared to North American standards. However, they are very skilled drivers. It takes approximately 10 minutes to get from the hotel to the subway station.Subways in Beijing are very busy. If you take the subway during rush hour (morning and evening), prepare to be packed like a sardine. Having said that, the subway is beautiful, frequent, and effecient. You can get practically anywhere in Beijing with 2RMB. You can also take Public Buses - very easy and cheap. Only 1RMB cash fare. There are hundreds of bus lines that will take you anywhere you want. For long buses, get on at the middle door. There will be a fare collector on the left. For short buses, get on at the front, the bus driver has a machine to collect money. Taxis are everywhere in Beijing. But beware - even registered and official drivers will rip you off. Although taxis are very cheap compared to North America, drivers, seeing that you are not native, will trick you. Know how much the trip should cost, hold a map, make sure the driver doesn't make stupid turns. You will waste time and money if the driver tricks you. But even if you do know where you are going, the driver will simply ignore your advice and continue. Beware. Never take taxis during rush hour, especially on streets like Changan and Jian Guo. It will take forever and make you frustrated. The Hotel's amenities are very good. There is a computer for use in the lobby area (ask reception) and there is wifi in the lobby. There is a beautiful swimming pool/hot tub too. Sauna and steam is also available. A gym is also available.As for food, Beijing food is very cheap. You can eat out. But if you wish to cook, you can take the hotel shuttle to supermarkets. There is also a convenient 7-11 across the street where you can buy snacks.Overall very good hotel.\t\n",
    "Jan 1 2009 \tPerfect for Families\tMe, my husband and two sons (13 and 11) stayed at the Ascott Beijing for nine nights. Very convenient location close to a main subway line. Definately have the address printed in chinese when you come from airport as it is tucked down a side street. Driver may call hotel for direction but no problem. Taxis in front of hotel were pleniful. Nice security and we always felt safe. A couple of restaurants, teahouses and Starbucks in the complex as well as a massage place (not too good), a convenience store for milk, yogurts, cereal, pasta, soda, etc. All very convenient. EXCELLENT Italian restaurant onsite called Casa Mia. This proved invaluable when travelling with two American kids who are fickle eaters. Owner is from Italy and food is good and reasonably priced. Fresh mozzeralla pizza was GREAT (about $9.00 US). My husband enjoyed the lasagna. They will deliver up to your room which is great after a day of touring with two very tired kids. My husband and I actually went to the restaurant and ate alone while we had an order sent up to the kids in the apartment. We had a two bedroom 2.5 bathroom apartment. Very spacious and clean. Large kitchen and master bathroom were wonderful. Housekeeping was excellent. Very small clothes washer/dryer but enough for a vacation. Pool and fitness area were also excellent. Most of the time we had the pool to ourselves and there were always plenty of clean towels. Good staff at the desk.\t\n",
    "Nov 18 2008\tChoice for Western Visitors\tI stayed at The Ascott from October 24-28, 2008. We arrived in Beijing late in the evening after a day of flying. Just as previously written, the taxi driver had some diffiiculty locating the hotel. We brought along the phone number. The taxi driver called and got directions. We booked a two bedroom and it was a very comfortable and nice room. The room was large and had a full kitchen, laundry room, dining room and living area. The hotel is about a ten minute walk to the nearest subway although we used taxi most of the time. They are cheap. The hotel was very helpful in establishing taxi fees up front and coordinating out trip to Badaling. Most of the front desk staff speaks very good English. We ate at the Italian restaurant in the hotel one evening and it was very good although the waitress was a litle hesitant with her English. The owner/chef was Italian and vey helpful. There is a Starbucks and convenience store in the hotel. The breakfast was good and they had a wide variety of foods to pick from.Besides the Pearl and Silk Markets, I enjoyed the in room massage the best. We had massages in the shop downstairs and noticed they will come to room for massage service for the same price. After a day of shopping and sightseeing this came in handy. For 100 yuan or about $14.00, we had private massages in the room for one hour. It was so relaxing. Overall, a pleasant stay.\t\n",
    "Nov 15 2008 \tVery good place for family vacations\tWe booked a 2 bedrooms suite through hotels.com for a stay in end october and were wery happy with this hotel.It was a key success factor of our vacations in Beijing.Our two young kids (7 and 3) had a large space in the living room to play, and thanks to the kitchen, we were able to prepare them the breakfast they liked.The washing machine was very useful, and despite the fact that the program were written in chinese.We used to get food delivered at the room from the italian and japanese restaurant that are located in the same building : it was very good and cheap, and much convenient for our tired kids.We used the convenience store of the hotel and the 7/11 to buy complementary food, such as yoghort.The swimming pool was great and clean.The location is very convenient. We rarely used the subway, as the travel time by taxi was shortened, due to the fact that traffic regulations to imit traffic were still in force. It took us only 20 minutes to go to the summer palace at 12h00!!WE even finally extended our stay. The people at the front desk were very honest, recommanding us to book through hotels.com, but as were was no more availability on the web site, we finally booked directly with the hotel.As far as we could see, this hotel is located at 5 minutes by walk of a wall mart.A very good place to recomend to all families.\t\n",
    "Sep 20 2008\tReally Good Alternative Accomodation in Beijing\tMy friends and I stayed at this apartment hotel which is nicely located near a metro stop, Guomao, in the Chaoyang District. The room/apartment was two bedrooms a large living room and full kitchen with a modest size laundry room. Though the washing machine did not work. This was great for our short stay and would have been even better if we were there for a week. The front desk works just as any hotel in the ability to book tours, change currency, and get transport. A, 1 - computer, business center, with free access is also available as well as two restaurants in the building, a Subway, and a Citibank ATM. If you decide that you actually prefer to eat in the apartment rather than the restaurants there is a 7-11 down the block where you can get fixings to make an omelet for breakfast.  Two issues:* For some reason the cab drivers have a really hard time finding this hotel so if you use it make sure to have not only the address but the phone number. Every cab ride we had to have the cabbie call the hotel despite them having the card with the address (in Chinese) to get the directions. Cabbies are willing to make the call.* Second was the cab con that we had at our departure. After booking for a cab the night before for a 5:30 am pick up to the airport for Y150 we woke up to find out that the cabbies suddenly wanted Y200 because it was early and it was raining. BS, and this was something the concierge was pushing. And then they wanted to push it to two cabbies because of our luggage and wanted to be paid before we left. Hey I'm from NYC. No money up front, got to the airport and paid Y150 and we also did not agree to pay the Y10 toll though we did have to do it with two cabs. I blame the hotel because I saw the concierge take his&quot;cut&quot; from the cabbies before we left.\t\n",
    "Aug 29 2008 \tGreat family hotel\tThis is a great hotel for a family. Our family of five booked the two bedroom/two bath suite for two weeks. It was beautiful - marble kitchen and bathrooms. It had a large dining and living area. It even had a washer/dryer. Housekeeping came daily and thoroughly cleaned our room. The gym was nice and the pool was huge. We could find a taxi easily and it is located in a nice neighborhood. The staff was also friendly.\t\n",
    "Jun 28 2008 \tExcellent in every respect\tI stayed at the Ascott for 9 nights in April this year. My stay there was excellent, in every respect:* Check-in: fast, efficient, and I was upgraded to a HUGE 2-bedroom, 2-bath apartment (see photos), it must have been 200 square meters.* Location: VERY convenient, in CBD Chaoyang, 50 meters on a back road from JianGuoMen DaJie (it is basically right behind the Motorola Tower, any Beijinger will know where that is), 150 meters from the Guo Mao subway station on the Third Ring Road, 200 meters from the China World Trade Ctr. There are taxis almost always outside the hotel.Room: VERY spacious, clean, fully-equipped kitchen, separate laundry room(!), L'Occitane toiletries in the bathrooms, LCD TVs, ample closet spaces.* On-site facilities: Everything you'll need: 4-5 restaurants leasing space from the hotel: Thai, Japanese, Italian, Starbucks...I had food delivered to my room from the Italian restaurant, very good and fast.There is a mini-market on the premises with everything you might need for a short stay, a Citibank ATM on the premises(!), and a 711 2-minute walk. Great gym, huge, with nice views, looked newly renovated, new equipment, and it was empty every time I went there.I believe the pool was closed for renovation, so no opinion on that.Service: One word: excellent. Example: I'd call Housecleaning right before I'd go downstairs to the gym so they come to clean the room, I come back from the gym 1 hour later and the apartment is made up and the cleaning lady is ready to leave! In other words, immediate housekeeping on request.Tip at the Beijing airport: have with you the address of your hotel in CHINESE, or at least the phone number, so the taxi driver can call them to get the address.\t\n",
    "May 14 2008 \tRecommended with one strong consideration\tI found the comments here to be generally true when I arrived at this hotel with my husband and toddler. The rooms are huge and well-appointed. The grocery store downstairs, though small, contains many western foods which can be difficult to find otherwise as does the reasonable lobby restaurant. HOWEVER, my husband has a bad lower back and the bed was intolerable for him. Generally speaking, hotel beds are better for him but this is basically a thick futon. I thought it felt like sleeping on a hay bale. The hotel (after 3 calls and one direct chat with the guest services director) switched out the mattress to something they said was softer, but it was basically the same. We had to pack up and relocate after the first night. We are both in our late 30s and not that out of shape! Also, the pool which I specifically picked for the toddler was closed. And the staff is rather limited on English, but that seems typical in Beijing.\t\n",
    "Nov 4 2007 \tExcellent choice for Beijing\tI stayed at the Ascott Beijing for two months during Sep / Oct 2007. Rooms were spacious and generally well maintained. Of the three rooms I stayed in I only had issues with one, which were resolved without fuss.I had previously stayed at a 5 star hotel in Beijing, and the Ascott provided larger, better furnished rooms at a cheaper rate. The building housing the Ascott includes a number of restaurants and shops (Thai, Japanese, Chinese, Italian, Starbucks, Subway, a 24 hour convenience store, an ATM, ...).Large pool and gym with new equipment. Reception staff generally speak good English but other staff do not (this is standard for China). Only issue would be that I didn't find the buffet breakfast fantastic (but I am quite fussy).\t\n",
    "Nov 1 2007\tDidn't want to leave!\tWe rented a two bedroom deluxe apartment using the hotel's website it came to about $200. One of the rooms was a master bedroom, the other a regular bedroom with the bathroom across the hall (great for a family, might be an issue for two couples). The apartment had a full kitchen and a laundry room with a washer/dryer (small loads work best).The apartment was large, it was well lit and felt very luxurious.When we arrived the room was still being cleaned by a small army of maids so we spent some time at the Starbucks downstairs reading the free and very useful Time Out Beijing and That's Beijing papers. Forget about guide books, they are obsolete the moment they are published in fast changing China.The hotel's rooms are in two towers (East and West) which you can access using your room card. You also use your room card to activate the elevator. This felt very safe. There are a few restaurants, a couple of art galleries, a massage place, a convenience store and a very neat tea house in the same building.Breakfast is served in the nearby Casa Mia Italian restaurant. The website called it a continental breakfast, but it's much more than that. There are eggs, noodles, congee, vegetables, in addition to the more usual muffins and cereal.I found the staff to be very friendly and helpful. Problems like missing toiletries and a leaky fridge were taken care of right away. I would recommend a stay here to anyone who's traveling in larger groups.The hotel provides Internet access for an extra fee and can arrange excursions and airport transfers for you, but those are usually more expensive then doing it yourself (about twice as expensive). The Guomao subway stop is close by and can get you to Tianamen square and the Forbidden City very easily. Taxis were always available.The airport shuttles get you pretty close to the hotel (take #1 and the stop is #3 - Guomao). It's only 16 Yuan, but not very comfortable. A taxi will cost about 85-100 Yuan and is probably a better option. The airport staff is completely unhelpful and will try to sell you on tours to the Great Wall and expensive shuttle services (3-4 times what it would cost by taxi). Of course all this might change with the Olympics. Hopefully for the better.\t\n",
    "Sep 18 2007 \tAbsolutely delighted with this hotel!\tI wasn't looking for an apartment - just somewhere I could fit 2 adults and 2 kids without having to pay for 2 hotel rooms. We paid the special rate of 888RMB nightly for the Ascott Beijing, booked on the Ascott website. The location was very good - you could walk to shops &amp; restaurants, or it was easy to get a taxi. The Silk Market was walking distance.The apartment itself was divine - one of the nicest I have ever stayed in. It had two bedrooms, two bathrooms, full kitchen &amp; laundry. It's obviously set up for expats who stay long term. After the tiny room we had in Shanghai, this was an absolute delight. We arrived early and paid an extra half day to check into our room early. Then it seemed a pity to leave it for the next five days, but clearly we did because we managed to cover its expansive spaces with shopping.\t\n",
    "Apr 9 2007 \tOk - but Service can be frustrating\tMy family (wife, 3 kids, in-laws) spent four nights in a 3BR apartment at the Ascott in Beijing. The room was decent, although clearly fraying around the edges with worn carpet. The room is in need of updating. Quite inexcusably, we were put in a 3BR apartment in a wing of the hotel where the other apts. were being renovated. So during the day we had workmen walking up and down the halls and we returned each day to the smell of fresh paint in the area.The biggest problem is that the service is not up to par. For example, when we checked in, we only had 4 sets of towels in a 3 BR apartment that sleeps at least 6 people. Not sure if they think you're going to take turns or something. When we asked for more towels, they brought two sets up and asked us to sign for them (never had that happen in a hotel). When we asked for some additional sets (we like to have extras on hand), both on-duty housekeepers came up and told us we more than enough towels and that we could exchange towels, not get additional sets. At one point, they accused us of wanting to steal the towels.After engaging the front desk, we finally got a few extra sets of towels, but it clearly wasn't worth the hassle. We had other minor problems throughout the stay. While we enjoyed the extra space, the kitchen and laundry facilities and the price was relatively inexpensive, in some ways it was more hassle than it was worth.\t\n",
    "Nov 1 2006 \tGood value but watch the beds!\tThe Ascott Beijing is perfect for those wanting to stay in a service apartment in the city, and for the added space you pay hardly anymore than for a hotel room. The Ascott is well appointed with large rooms and comfortable open spaces. It is also well situated in the Guo Mao area with a line of taxis behind for easy travel (easy being relative because as soon as you leave the hotel by taxi you enter the city's increasingly horrid traffic).The Ascott also had an indoor pool which is useful in the cooler months and a good gym. There is even a massage centre right down stairs (not run by the hotel but they are permitted to go to your room).The only issue - albeit an important one - I had with the Ascott Beijing was the quality of their beds - they were were just too hard. And when I say hard its not a matter of too firm, but actually too hard! You don't feel like you are getting any support which leads to unfulfilling sleep. For a service residence of this caliber this is certainly a disappointment and a reason why I may consider staying at the Ascott Beijing again. My rating for the hotel would otherwise be a &quot;5&quot; or excellent.\t\n",
    "Oct 2 2006 \twant a convenient alternative to a 5 star beijing hotel?\ttraveling to china four times annually since year 1998 and staying at 4 and 5 star rated hotels in beijing, i tried the ascott in 2003 as an alternative. the ascott provides the leisure and business traveler a refreshing alternative with the bonus of twice the floor space of a western style hotel suite. another attraction is the ascott's location. it is situated in the most desireable area of beijing known as choyang or the central business district where the center of government, shopping, and branded hotels are domiciled. the ascott may not have the name recognition of the western chains...yet; but if you need high speed internet, a convenient location, english speaking staff, and a spacious accomodation, you will be pleasantly surprised with this hidden jewel.\t\n",
    "Jul 7 2006\tPretty nice place\tI just stayed at the Ascott with seven of my family members in June 2006, and we all thought that it was pretty nice. This is not really a hotel; it's a serviced apartment. So, it is meant to be used long-term by business travelers. The benefit for short-term travlers is that the Ascott has several different apartment configurations, and it is one of the few options in Beijing (that I know of) where larger groups can stay comfortably. We rented two apartments, each of which had two bedrooms and two bathrooms (1800Y a night). The apartments were tastefully decorated with full kitchens (granite countertops, stainless appliances, etc.). The service was very good, and the location is convenient -- behind the Motorola Building on the intersection of Jianguomen and Third Ring Road, kitty corner from the World Trade Hotel and the Guomao subway station. There's a Starbucks in the same building, and there are several places to eat. A Minsheng Bank is located right across the street from the lobby, which has an ATM machine that takes all the cards, and there is a 7-11 about 30 yards down the street -- nice when you need cold beer or water at all hours of the night.Like many other properties in China, the quality of workmanship in the hotel rooms leaves something to be desired -- uneven grout lines, messy caulking, etc. If you've stayed at other hotels in China, you know exactly what I mean. This would be my one reservation about the place, but it didn't seem to bother people in our group. In other words, it's not a five-star hotel, but it's trying hard. The place still provides one of the best options for larger groups of people (On this, I agree with the earlier poster.). If you're interested, you can find photos online at the Ascott's website, which provide a reliable idea about how the apartments look.\t\n",
    "Nov 9 2005\tFantastic apartments\tMy family recently returned from a 10 day tour in China - our 4 days at the Ascott Beijing made for a fantastic finale. We got all the creature comforts of a hotel (nice furnishings, linens and maid service) combined with the privacy and space of a large apartment.We were a mixed group: two grandparents, three grandsons (11, 9, and 8 yrs old), their mom and me (the auntie). After 6 days in hotels and staying in 3 separate hotel rooms - with frequent calling between rooms to get organized for breakfast, dinner, etc - this luxurious apartment set up was a welcome change (and about the same price). Our 3 bedroom, 2.5 bathroom apartment seemed new and extremely clean. There was a washer/dryer combo, but it was so slow that it was just better to send our laundry out to a service. The kitchen was well appointed &amp; we could easily prepare our meals - the maid service helped finish up the dishes we inevitably left behind each morning.For the kids, the big pool and hot tub were a blast - a much needed energy release every day. Very clean &amp; pretty with big towels. For younger children there is a babypool, a playroom and for adults a nice gym.The breakfast buffet that came with our room rate was not all that great, but we went a couple times anyway. Plus, it was fun to see some of the ex-pat families that basically live at the Ascott.The location was pretty good, with a nice 'western' style market within walking distance. I would highly recommend this hotel/apartment building for travelling families or groups. It was so much easier to communicate and coordinate, that we were more relaxed for the touring (and dealing with the terrible Beijing traffic).\t\n",
    "\tVERY NICE HOTEL\tWe get vacation every year after my wedding. But up to now more than four years we work hard and prepare for great vacation for 4 months we choose Asia is our destination First stop in Beijing we stayed in this hotel.Hotel not too big but the room was nice and comfortable. We liked this and enjoyed it.\t\n",
    "Nov 19 2009 \tA fantastic hotel\tMy boyfriend and I stayed in the Autumn Garden hotel at the end of our trans-siberian railway trip from Moscow and staying there was one of the highlights of an amazing holiday. Staying in the hutong was so much better than an international style hotel, we really felt that we experienced a 'real' bit of Beijing. We loved the choice of english or chinese breakfasts, the room was gorgeous and having free internet was incredibly useful. The location was wonderful too, only 10 minutes walk to Tiananmen square.\t\n",
    "Sep 11 2009 \tnice place to stay\tThe staff are extremely helpful and friendly, enabling you to find your bearings by providing a trishaw facility to the main road from the hotel. The location of the hotel is a 5 minute walk from Qianmen subway and the furnishings of the hotel rich in tradition. You may not get the western breakfasts you do in more modern hotels but it gives you an opportunity to live like the locals.\t\n",
    "Dec 14 2008 \tReccomended\tThis is a great little hotel, I booked this hotel based on previous reviews, so I thought I would come on here and recommend it myself.I went to Beijing on my own for 4 nights to see what its like. It is quite a crazy place, Chinese people seem to take advantage of tourists at every possible opportunity.The Autumn Garden Hotel however is amazing, such nice people, and I consider it a great price for what I got. Its location is great if you want to get a slight feel of what its like living in China.You need to walk down a couple of narrow alley ways to get to the Hotel, but it is very close to Tienanmen Square, with a lot of sites close by, such as the Temple of Heaven and Forbidden City within walking distance. Also there is a touring company with nice and cheap tours (although in Chinese) which is less than 10 minutes walk away next to Tienanmen Square.The rooms are clean and comfortable. Breakfast is simple but decent. The People are fantastic, talk English and are very very helpful. They picked me up from the airport without any charge, Im not sure if this is a regular service, but it was helpful. If it is your first time in China, I recommend getting picked up, as taxi drivers talk very little English if any at all, and the Hotel can be hard to find, Taxi drivers wont know it.The hotel welcomes you very nicely, and give you a map to the area and to the hotel, and even a mobile phone to use while you stay with them.The hotel had everything you should need, but I was truly impressed by the service there which easily allows me to recommend it. In contrast to most of the Chinese which I met who seemed to try and take me for every cent that I had, this little hotel was there for me for every need, without trying to charge me for the help that they offered, or even the things which I expected to pay for such as the half a day late checkout, or airport pick up.If you want a simple, relaxing, and friendly stay, try the Autumn Garden. I will no doubt be staying there again on my next visit.\t\n",
    "Nov 10 2008\tan oasis in Beijing\tJust got back from Beijing and a wonderful experience staying in the middle of a hutong (maze of alleyways) in Beijing, just next door to Tian'anmen Square. This inn is truly an oasis in a crazy busy city and right in the middle of what feels like 50 years ago - staff were so welcoming and accomodating - if you want a taxi, they have one - we went to the Great Wall with our very own driver - even had a (very simple) lunch prepared by one of the staff - who were all delightful - lovely courtyard - very quiet even though in the midst of chaos - a real feel for old China - haven't downloaded our photos yet, but willing to share if anyone is interested!\t\n",
    "Nov 1 2008 \tLovely traditional style hotel\tThis is a really lovely traditional style hotel, located literally just 5 minutes walk away from Tianmen square as well as lots of eating options &amp; shops. The girls at the front desk were very friendly, helpful and spoke good english. The rooms are very pretty and comfortable, with modern western style bathrooms. Since it's located in the hutong (lots of narrow, confusing alley ways) It's a good idea to take with you the address of the hotel writen in Chinese characters as well as the phone number, so the taxi driver can call for directions. We were given a mobile to use during our stay - and took it with us when we went off to North Korea for a week and then called when we got back, and they sent out a car to pick us up from the station. On our return we also got upgraded to a bigger room. The bathrooms were pretty much the same in both rooms - the sinks make a brilliant nose when you tap them. I booked, as I usually do, on www.venere.com - this is an excellent website and no down payment required.\t\n",
    "Aug 25 2008 \tLiving it the Beijing way\tAs I was looking for accommodation for my visit during the Olympics in late 2007, most of the major hotels were not available for booking for IOC-related room blocks. Which means when I booked it everything everywhere was very expensive. Then I found this little courtyard hotel, and was charged at least 4 times their published rates, yet still I am happy with what I got. Situated 3 &quot;layers&quot; deep from the main streets, you will either need to have good map reading skills to navigate your way to find this on your own... or you could use their free tricycle service which would pick you up from either Qianmen or Hepingmen Quanjude Roast Duck Restaurant.I love the surrounding of this guesthouse. It is a typical hutong where houses are one next to the other, and rather peaceful and quiet. That means it's not the best place to stay if you are expecting upper class and polished streets. In fact, you will find at least 3 smelly public toilets along the way to the guesthouse. But that's what's genuine about the neighbourhood. The location is also quite fantastic... a 5-10 minute walk (or less with tricycle) would bring you to the subway station (Hepingmen and Qianmen), and also Tiananmen Square... that's a big plus for those who like to travel the local way (on foot or subway).Rooms are not big, but adequate, with modern bathroom amenities (good and strong hot showers!). Room rates include free use of internet and breakfast (Chinese or western style, pick whatever you want).You cannot reach this place by taxi, so be ready to have a little hassle when you arrive and depart. The tricycle rider is friendly and could get you to the main streets. I arrived in a chauffeured car and the driver had no clue where it was and luckily I did my research and found the property myself. Although I paid the rate for a 5-star hotel, I wouldn't have done it any other way.\t\n",
    "Oct 11 2009 \tA hidden gem\tWe stayed at this hotel for 4 nights at the start of our holiday and again for 3 nights before returning to the UK. We chose this hotel as a change from the main chain hotels in Beijing which we have stayed in on previous visits.This is a lovely hotel within reasonable walking distance, through the hutongs, to the lakes Houhai &amp; Quanhai. The metro line is a short walk from the hotel and taxis are cheap and plentiful on the main road near to the hotel.Despite being in a very busy part of Beijing the hotel is exceptionally quite and peaceful. We had a suite on the ground floor (room 407). The bed was giantic but, as with most Chinese beds, quite hard. The pillows were the best pillows I have ever slept on and the linen was spotlessly clean as were the rooms.The lounge room furntiure was classical Chinese carved wood, gorgeous to look at but not the most comfortable to sit on. We had a computer in the room with free internet acess which was a bonus. The rooms and the bathroom were spotless. Due to the position of our room there was not a lot of natural light.Breakfast was included in our deal and was ok. The main problem was that some of the food was not hot, in fact somtimes not even warm. That said there was a very good variety and the staff were helpful and friendly.All the staff were very helpful and we would highly recommend this hotel to anyone who doesn't wish to stay in a tall, concrete block where every room is the same.\t\n",
    "Sep 23 2009 \tAll we were hoping for was there\tI booked this hotel based on the reviews I read on Tripadvisor and I found everything I was looking for. The place is beautiful, clean and ideally located, close to the subway (which is very easy to use and gets you quickly anywhere in the city center) and to a number of lovely little restaurants where you can enjoy amazing dinners for less than 10 dollars. The staff is helpful and the frontdesk service impeccable: all of them proved to be attentive and exceedingly kind ( they helped us book restaurants and wrote directions in Chinese for us to show in case we got lost). Besides you get a very good exchange rate for your currency (much better than the one you get at the airport). We also booked from them a taxi service from the airport to the hotel. It wasn't cheap (150 yuan when you would usually pay 60) but we were extremely pleased with it. The driver met us at the arrival gate and we managed to check in without any problem 20 minutes after claiming our luggage - which is good after a 12-hour-long flight. The hutong location is fascinating and absolutely safe. We tried the dumplings place next door recommended by one of the reviewers. It doesn't look very inviting from the outside (the decor is indeed basic) but it is always packed with locals for a good reason: the food is delicious (expect to pay around 5 dollars for your meal).The computer (with free broadband internet) available in every rooms is also very useful.\t\n",
    "Aug 16 2009 \tGreat value for Money\tExcellent room with own computer, great location close to sights, breakfast not great, service okay.\t\n",
    "Jul 29 2009 \tExcellent character hotel\tWe were delighted with this choice of hotel. It’s situated down a Hutong and takes you by surprise on approach. The road is a bit scruffy but don’t let that put you off. The hotel is a quiet oasis and a short walk from lots of restaurants and the old Bell and Drum towers. The reception staff were friendly (in contrast to some reports that I’d read) and spoke good English. The hotel buildings are set around a tranquil courtyard. The bedrooms are a good size and decorated in Chinese style. There was a huge, comfortable bed. The room was very clean with a nice bathroom and a good shower. There was even a PC in the room for free internet access! The air conditioning worked although I would have liked it to be a little cooler.The breakfast buffet was decent and had enough western food. We ate at the hotel one evening and found it to be very good value.We found it easy to navigate our way to this hotel as it is on the edge of the Hutongs.I would definitely stay here again.\t\n",
    "Jul 19 2009 \tCourtyard hotel in the hutongs\tWe stayed in a Deluxe Suite for the first several nights of our honeymoon. The room was very large with a bedroom, sitting room and 1.5 bathrooms. The bathrooms were large, modern and clean. The bed was very comfortable with a wooden canopy and red silk bed spread. There was a mini bar, a huge flat screen television and (huge bonus) a computer with free internet access. The staff were polite and even kept the restaurant open for us when we arrived 5 minutes before closing. The food in the restaurant for dinner and breakfast was average but I would recommend going outside the hotel for meals, especially down to the Houhai Lake area. We rented bikes from the hotel which was an adventurous experience. The only negative was the construction just outside the hotel on the road. Since the hotel is in the hutongs, the road was very narrow and we had to walk through the muddy construction to the main road to get a taxi. This hotel is a 15/20 minute walk north of the Drum Tower/Houhai Lake area.\t\n",
    "Jun 1 2009 \tLovely boutique hotel with good service\tThis hotel had character...genuine Chinese decor which was very pleasing, and a large campus, which we did not explore fully. The restaurant was very good, and everything we ate was well prepared and reasonably priced.There was always someone at the front desk who spoke excellent English, so there was never any problems of communication. The exchange rate offered for currency conversion was also very good. On request, they arranged airport pickup for 150 Rmb, which was a bit on the high side, but efficiently arranged (we managed the return airport trip in 100 Rmb quite easily by another taxi).They also arranged a taxi for the Great Wall for 600 Rmb, which again was slightly on the high side. We tried doing some flight bookings through their travel agent, but his quotes were very high; found much better rates on Ctrip. My only complaint is that the hotel seems to be trying to make too much money on the side by padding up taxi rates, travel agent fees etc.Their website says that they have a laundry room. I presumed that meant we could use the services of a washing machine/dryer. That is not true. They offer laundry services at prohibitive &quot;per piece&quot; rates, so beware.Location is central, but about a 10 minute walk from the Golou metro stop. Wish it was a little closer. Right in the middle of the &quot;Hutong&quot; neighborhood though.Overall good value for money in Beijing. Good rooms, decent prices, and overall quite comfortable. Oh yes, the free computer terminal in the room with internet was a big plus.\t\n",
    "May 22 2009 \tA peacefull place in a very busy city\tWe booked a few nights in this hotel after our trip on the Transmongolia Express. Our travelagent tipped us and she didn't lie: Bamboo Garden is a beautiful hotel. It is in one of the socalled hutongs and it is extremely peacefull. And that is what you need after spending a day in busy Beijing. The staff is nice and helpfull, the rooms are very spacious, nicely decorated and fully equiped. Closeby are good restaurants and bars, shops, one of Beijings lakes.... even within walking distance.There is a computer with internet (ofcourse, so the government can keep an eye on things) in your room, which is very usefull.We had a very pleasant stay!\t\n",
    "Apr 8 2009 \tExcellent hotel\tThis was my second stay at the hotel - the first was in 2005 - and the hotel has only got better since. Rooms are beautiful and have TV and a computer with internet access.The bathrooms are well equipped and the shower was brlliant.The hotel is very peaceful and is located in the hutong not far from shops, bars and restaurants. The hotel restaurant serves lovely food at very reasonable prices - around £5 for a main dish. I have recommended this hotel to everyone I know who has travelled to Beijing and everyone has raved about it.\t\n",
    "Mar 31 2009 \tThe Very Best\tThis was just a wonderful experience staying at this hotel.The experience did not start out well as I arrived at night and the taxi driver could not locate the lane that the hotel is situated in. When the lane was found it was blocked by a truck and car so we had to walk with our luggage the last part of the lane.This was the only negative to our stay.This is a small hotel in a historic building. The room was excellentwith modern facilities looking out onto spacious gardens.All of the staff were very attentive and spoke very good English. Front office was very helpful and quickly attended to onward bookings, money changingand sightseeing suggestions etc.The only meals that I had at the hotel was breakfasts and these were excellent, freshly cooked eggs and bacon and a wide selection of both Chinese and Western Foods.The location of the hotel is great with a great number of restaurants very close by. A must try is the Le Little Saigon which is very close by and is an excellent restaurant providing both French and Vietnamese dishes.Nearby are both subway, bus and many taxis.It is convenient to many local attractions including The Forbidden City. A walk to the nearby lake is a must.This hotel is truly a hidden gem and I will return.\t\n",
    "Mar 6 2009 \tVery convenient location for business!\tWe stayed in this hotel for 3 nights on business in Beijing. We love the hotel's location because it's very convenient for us in business or appointment with our dealers. Moreover, staff were very helpful during our staying.Highly recommended this hotel to everyone.\t\n",
    "Feb 22 2009 \tDecent hotel\tI stayed here for 7 nights in late November 2008. The room I wanted was actually booked so they put me in a suite for the same price prior to my arrival. The suite came with a computer which included free Internet access as well as free water. Service was average but being close to the subway was a plus. Felt safe in the area although the alley to the hotel gets dark at night. This isn't a &quot;must stay at&quot; hotel by any stretch so feel free to scout out other places.\t\n",
    "Feb 17 2009 \tAwesome rooms great hotel grounds helpful staff DUMPLINGS!\tWhen we passed the dumpling house and little &quot;bodega&quot; before entering the hotel grounds we knew we were in for a treat! Free internet was a delightful treat after being in Morocco, India, and Egypt the month before. The beds were super comfortable, very very clean room with a nice view of the courtyard. The grounds themselves were an &quot;oasis&quot; in the middle of this sprawling city. Had no trouble getting a cab to hike the Great Wall. There's a cool commercial district with shops and restaurants within walking distance (go to the right out of the little alleyway on the main street and down about 15mins). Oh yeah, the dumpling house that was next door was killer. 15 delightful dumplings for mere $s.If we had been able to have a room with 1 bed instead of 2, that would have been the only change we wanted. Definitely book.\t\n",
    "Jan 23 2009 \tA quiet place to stay...\tFirst of all we did have a hard time finding a taxi from the airport that would take us to the hotel because none of them knew where it was. We finally found a driver who was willing to try to find it and he called the hotel from his cell phone and took us directly to the hotel--no problem. The hotel is down a small alley lined with little stores and restaurants but is off a busy main street lined with restaurants and shops and lots of taxi's to take you where you wish to go. The subway is a short 10 minute walk from the hotel and will take you around the city even cheaper and as fast as the taxi's. The hotel was beautiful and comfy. Our room looked out over the gardens and the bed was very soft compared to other beds I have slept on in China. Free internet was a plus also (computer in the room). We only ate at the hotels restaruant for breakfast (a nice blend of Asian and Western food) for about 60 RMB. If you wish all the bells and whistles of a large hotel don't stay here--it's a small, quiet, friendly hotel that was a pleasure to return to each night.\t\n",
    "Nov 15 2008 \tVery pleased with our choice!\tWe were just delighted with the Bamboo Garden Hotel! The gardens are lovely and our room nicely decorated and comfortable. We enjoyed our stay very much. The food at the hotel restaurant was delicious. Be forewarned, the first time you walk down the alleyway to the hotel you might think you've made a big mistake. You haven't! You will be very pleasantly surprised as to what awaits you.The ladies at the front desk are helpful and efficient, but not exactly warm or charming. Perhaps just a cultural difference.It is close to the subway and just a little way to the south there is a terrific park with lakeside eating choices. Wishing you a great time in Beijing!\t\n",
    "Oct 21 2008 \tMemorable hotel\tWe stayed in Bamboo Garden Hotel during the Beijing leg of our China Tour primarily because we don't want generic looking hotels so much and we were not disappointed. It is located in the Hotungs and not very &quot;famous&quot; with taxi drivers but they were always helpful and we were able to go back no problem with help of the hotel card. The staff were friendly and very helpful. Simple service that feels genuine and none of those super trained 5 star hotel types. We went together with our 11 month old and 3 yr old kids. The staff were very kind and entertained them while we are waiting for some reception confirmation, taxi etc. The rooms are ok, clean with huge firm beds. My baby didn't like the crib they provided though( too small) so she slept with us. The huge bed was great!My 3 year old son loved the hotel so much. It's look, it's garden , with the blue birds and especially the red lanterns at night. Until now he still talks about the Bamboo Hotel and asks us to go back :)For my husband the best part is the massage. Really relaxing after a day of touring. The in room computer is also great as we didn't have room to bring our laptop with all the kiddie gear we had. There are several small eateries around but we didn't get to try them. The drumtower is also nearby and from the drumtower other places of interest are a stroll away. Definitely a good location especially if you love walking or biking around. We did not walk so much though with 2 kids in tow. But taxi was not hard to come by :)\t\n",
    "Oct 6 2008\tHello from Lee\tI really enjoyed our stay in the Bamboo Garden Hotel and on my next trip in January 2009 I will also be staying again. Thank you very much for your kindness and the warm hospitality – especially the help with our visas! Ciao and kisses from the children!\t\n",
    "Sep 9 2008 \tPerfect Hotel Oasis in Beijing!\tLike a beautiful bamboo oasis in the middle of urban Beijing, the Bamboo Garden Hotel is an authentic, beautiful and cozy place to hang your hat. The asian inspired rooms are full of comfortable chairs, couches and come equipped with a computer, flat screen tv and meticulously clean bathrooms. The mattresses are a bit hard, but the super soft bedding more than makes up for it. The grounds of the hotel are great to explore and have a couple quaint ivy covered courtyards, red lanterned walkways and mini ponds w/ koi.The breakfast buffet is 60 yuan extra, but convenient and delicious! The front desk staff speak very good english and are very attentive. Tours can be booked through the desk, and money can be changed as well. The location can't be beat - five minute walk to the subway (which is definitely the best way to get around town) ...and a 10 minute walk to the hip part of town where all the trendy restuarants are popping up. We opted for the airport pick up &amp; the driver was right on time!I highly recommend the Bamboo Garden Hotel.. enjoy!\t\n",
    "Aug 20 2008 \tNice hotel in a nice area\tBamboo Garden hotel is located 5-7 minutes to Gulou subway station in a hutong. One can reach the bell and drum towers and the Houhai Lake in less than 10 minutes walking. Especially the lake is quiet nice with lots of shops, restaurants, public dancing and singing etc.The hotel is very quiet, there are some nice courtyards and lots of stuff to care about guests. Our standard suite for app. 800 RMB (close to the Olympics) was very nice, large and clean. It was equipped with a large flat screen TV with lots of foreign channels and a computer with broadband internet. Breakfast was very good but relatively pricey for 60 RMB. Small shops and a supermarket are around the corner.We especially enjoyed staying in a small hotel in a hutong area and not in a large chain-hotel, which seem to be located mostly at main roads with lots of traffic.\t\n",
    "Aug 18 2008 \tHotel History\tI stayed at this Hotel a long time ago but would highly reccomend it. I chose this hotel because I had just read &quot;Claws of the Dragon&quot; by John Byron and John Pack., a biography of Kang Sheng, a high level Politburo member during the Cultural Revolution. If you are planing on staying here read this book for some facinating background\t\n",
    "Aug 17 2008 \tA Beijing Getaway\tThe best part of this hotel is that it's not in the hotel district; it's located in a residential area in an old part of the city, a walled district known as a huotang. Also, most guests are independent travelers. We did not encounter any tour groups. The hotel restaurant is excellent and cheap. We had a semi-deluxe room, which was small but adequate. Bathroom was fine, lots of hot water. The air conditioner was loud and it took the staff a day or two to get the temperature right. Beds are hard as they are everywhere in China, but housekeeping put a quilt underneath the sheet for us. Service is great even when you can't find anyone who speaks English. We booked by sending Wendy an e-mail from the hotel website. She arranged our stay, and an excursion to the Jinshanling part of the Great Wall for 150 USD. Do arrange for an airport pick-up, about $25 to $30 USD. It's more expensive than a cab but you won't risk the driver not knowing where the place is. The hotel is close to a subway stop on a line that will take you to all the sites.\t\n",
    "Jul 14 2008 \tPeaceful Oasis\tI recently spent 3 nights at the Bamboo Garden Hotel with my husband and teenage son. The taxi driver struggled to find the hotel &amp; had to stop to get directions. As we searched for the hotel I was concerned as the area was run down and known as the hutongs. However, as soon as we arrived we knew we had found a hidden gem.The room was filled with authentic furniture and yet it had modern features. The hotel &amp; grounds were peaceful. We particularly enjoyed our visits to the Tea Room which had an underfloor fish pool. The staff were friendly and would not accept tips.We would definitely stay here again.\t\n",
    "May 22 2008 \tA great small hotel\tI couldn't agree more with Greystones 23 who took the words right out of my mouth. My wife and I also stayed there in April and the only thing I would add to Greystones comments would be that the hotel courtyard was also beautiful with the cherry and apple blossom in full bloom. There are ponds and waterfalls with goldfish, however I must say I did feel a little sorry for the few goldfish in the &quot; font &quot;. A Great little hotel and excellent value for money\t\n",
    "May 17 2008 \tA quiet oasis in a noisy city\tWe stayed here for 3 nights in April 2008 and found it a little oasis in a melee of noise, smells and sounds. We would certainly recommend this hotel.The staff were friendly and laughed at our attempts to try to say hello and thank you in Chinese but did try to help with our pronunciations. The rooms were clean and decorated in traditional Chinese style. The duvets were silk and were warm and comfortable. A tea tray was provided and all bathroom extras were there. The food was excellent when we stayed for dinner as were the breakfasts each morning. We did have to teach the girl behind the bar how to make gin and tonics! We took tea on the tea terrace where we were served tea by the boy with the 'long spouted kettle'.Because it is in a hutong you have to pass the public toilet which can smell a bit but it all adds to the life of the city and one that might disappear quickly with the rate of new building in Beijing. The hotel is bordered by a block of flats that overlooks the garden.\t\n",
    "May 10 2008 \tBamboo Garden - perfect!\tFamily of four stayed at the Bamboo Garden Hotel. We booked two rooms and both were clean, modern, and lovely. My son spoke some Chinese and that was helpful with the hotel staff.We booked a driver through the hotel to pick us up at the airport - but he/she never arrived. Fortunately, our son met us at the airport and we took a taxi to the hotel - for a lot less than we were quoted by the hotel website staff.The grounds were magical - after sightseeing, it was wonderful to sit on the patio and drink a beer among the blossoms.Hotel staff was helpful, friendly and attentive. Rooms had flat screen TV's and computers with internet access. Each bathroom had soap, shampoo, toothbrushes, toothpaste among other things.The hotel was located down a hutong - with stores that sold food, beer, tea, etc. Each room had a fridge to eat left over goodies from dinners.Hotel was located near many places to eat - all of them wonderful - and most importantly - the hotel was only a few blocks from the subway - a great way to travel in Beijing.I fully recommend this hotel.\t\n",
    "Apr 6 2008 \tBamboo Garden Beijing a fantastic unconventional hotel\tFantastic experience. I frequently travel for business, but this time it was an holiday I took with my wife in China. In Bamboo Garden Hotel we found nice and kind staff, English is spoken. Western breakfast is available andThe internal restaurant is also good. The hotel was an old noble house of a former imperial minister. Clean, quiet, nice with a wide garden and internal relaxing sight. The hotel is situated in the hutong area, and arriving by taxi, entering in the small street inside the Hutongs, you could have some doubts about your booking...Don't worry: the area is absolutely safe and secure, and entering in the hotel environment you think you are entering in a small paradise in a different time. There you can feel the real chinese life, living in a fantastic environment.This hotel is different than the usual buiness or travel hotels, and we spent our days in Beijing in a non conventional excellent hotel. I recommended it to friends and, for sure, for my next time in Beijing I will reserve again in Bamboo Garden.\t\n",
    "Mar 16 2008\tLiked this hotel but problems getting a taxi\tThere was a lot to like about the Bamboo Garden. Lovely rooms, beautiful garden, great location in the hutongs with a lot of character. And free Internet!The biggest drawback seemed to be getting back at the end of the day. We didn't have a car and driver while in Beijing, so we had our guide write out the name of the hotel (with directions) in Mandarin to give to a taxi driver. However, taxis didn't seem to want to drive to the hutongs, or to be clear on how to get there. One night we had four taxis refuse to drive us before we finally found one who would. And they never drove us down our hutong -- which I understand, as it was quite narrow -- but they never even dropped us off at the right one. Fortunately, the first night we showed the directions to a local resident, who was able to point us in the right direction, and thereafter we memorized how to get there!The food at breakfast and the one dinner we ate there were average.Although we liked many things about the hotel, I wouldn't stay there again unless I had a driver that I knew would take me back at the end of each day.\t\n",
    "Feb 10 2008 \tPerfect welcome to China\tThe Bamboo Garden Hotel was a wonderful oasis of calm in the hustle and bustle of Beijing. I stayed here on my first trip to China, and I had wanted to stay someplace a little &quot;traditional&quot; and this ended up being the perfect choice. The courtyard and gardens are pretty, the facilities in general are nice, the restaurant is good (note the long-spouted tea kettles!), and while the rooms aren't luxurious per se, they are comfortable enough for the jetlagged body. I laughed when I read one negative review criticizing the hotel for not having marble floors, or soft fluffy towels, but give me a break ... this is China! If you want soft fluffy pillows stay at the Grand Hyatt--this is probably not the place for you. If you want a bit more of a traditional experience, and are a little more adventurous, stay here!A few other notes:- As others have commented, make sure you have cash on hand to pay for a taxi into town (the taxi is not associated with the hotel, so it can't just be added to your room fee) ... the airport has an ATM, so I'd recommend using it before heading into town, but the hotel will also change money.- The hotel is located very close to a subway stop ... Beijing's subway is a cheap, easy way to get around town.- Make sure you have the hotel's name in Chinese and a map in case you can't find your way back (but that applies to all hotels in China).- I have seen mixed reviews about the front desk staff ... personally the woman that helped us during our stay was very helpful in arranging activities like the Beijing Opera and transportation (we took a night train to Xi'an from Beijing).\t\n",
    "Feb 7 2008 \tA very good choice.\tBamboo Garden BeijingAn excellent choice. Delightful buildings set in beautiful courtyards in a hutong. Location excellent - two blocks to the metro which delivers one to the Forbidden City. Rooms excellent with a free computer. Very good restuarant and plenty of cheaper ones with an easy walk. Organised an excellent vehicle, driver and guide to visit the Great Wall.\t\n",
    "Nov 7 2007 \tFavorite hotel in China\tI just returned from a trip to China and have to say that my stay at the Bamboo Garden was my favorite. The neighborhood was safe and so interesting to wander around in. I t is just two blocks from the drum tower and a block from the subway station. The room was lovely and the gardens delightful. I enjoyed the restaurant very much. If you want a hotel with a true Chinese feeling to it, this is the place. I can't say enough about the staff who were so helpful and friendly. I was a single woman and felt very safe at the hotel and in the area. Communications with the hotel were promptly responded to and my request for a non smoking room was honored.\t\n",
    "Oct 17 2007 \tThe perfect getaway in Beijing\tWhat a pleasure to spend the last evening of a two-week whirlwind trip around China on the grounds of this lovely, peaceful hutong hotel.Our flight back into Beijing arrived late at night, but hotel staff was there at the airport ready to receive us and whisk us away to the hotel. Check-in was efficient, and bellhops were courteous and quiet. We were taken aback by the beauty of our room. We had asked for a room with a garden view. Before our eyes were beds covered in lovely Chinese-red comforters, beautiful traditional Chinese furniture, our own computer with internet access, an immaculate bathroom, and windows opening to the garden. We spent a peaceful night and morning in the room and then enjoyed a short stroll across the grounds. Far away is the chaos of Beijing. You're in another world at this hotel. We enjoyed lunch at the hotel restaurant. Tea served from a long-spouted pot, table positioned on top of the transparent floor through which we could see the green pond, courteous service, and delicious food: Eight Treasure Tofu Pot, Bamboo shoots with mushrooms, Sweet and sour pork, and Beijing-style noodles. We loved this meal.We would go back again and again to stay at this hotel. In fact, it is on our list of places to revisit in China.\t\n",
    "Sep 13 2007\tNice origional hotel\tVery good hotel for its three star rating. The staff is very friendly. The neighbourhood is not so exciting, but it's near the Beihaipark, so you can walk to that. The room is beautifull and the garden even so. A pity is it, when it is raining you can not sit in the garden.You have free internet, but when your computer has a hardware error you can not use it. The have to repair it, but they didnot came.\t\n",
    "Aug 26 2007\tOasis of peace and gardens good location nice rooms\tBamboo Garden has an authentic feel to it as soon as you step in, so we were surprised to find the flat screen TVs and in-room PC with fast Internet access (which I'm now using to write this review).Cons: room could be a bit cleaner (quite a lot of dust in ours), and the aircon doesn't really work that well. Breakfast isn't a highlight and not really recommended.Pros: rooms are full of character and comfortable, and it feels like you're staying in the real China (my perceived one, anyway). Location is close to old Beijing quarters and I'm pleased we didn't book one of the characterless tourist traps.The grounds and gardens are beautiful and peaceful. Overall we felt it was good value, a good location and a nice environment.\t\n",
    "Jul 27 2007\tA secret joy\tLike others we had a problem when the car &amp; driver we booked with the hotel to pick us up from the airport didn't show. &quot;Problem&quot;, they said &quot;between the sales desk and reception.&quot;. Hmmm. Fortunately it was late at night and a government taxi from the domestic terminal only cost 70 rmb - 50 rmb less than what the hotel wanted.  Also, as we never found a taxi driver that spoke ANY English, we were dropped off at the wrong guesthouse on this little lane. (Confusion over &quot;Zhu yuan&quot; and &quot;Ju yuan&quot;). So wandering down an unlit laneway at midnight, we were so very pleased to finally see the treasure hidden behind a tiny entrance gate. Once in our room, it was fantastic. The rooms had recently been redone, and the view from our ground floor window was as if we were in a huge park or garden. No noise from nearby reconstruction reached inside (double glazing perhaps), and despite the ferocious summer heat, the room was always cool (maybe a touch too cool).  Our bed was very firm - the Asian style - but I noticed a nagging back ache suddenly disappeared. Very surprised to see the computer with internet provided free in the room, along with the flat screen LCD TV with cable. Not many English channels, but we enough to find the weather and headlines. Room rates were higher than expected - a recent rate hike I expect. At 880 RMB we expected more of a suite, but we enjoyed it so much we didn't complain.  The staff were helpful but only if asked. Otherwise they would sit back and do other things until you were ready. We preferred this than always being bothered. Any time we did ask, no matter how trivial or small they jumped to it. Their English is barely passable, so a little Chinese will always help. Only had one breakfast in the restaurant (40RMB) which was a mixed buffet of Asian and Western (continental) plus a cook that would whip up eggs. The meal was certainly good, but we preferred the hutongs in the early morning where we could find Pork Buns for 7 1/2 jiao (0.75 RMB), and lovely spinach rolls (5 jiao). It was certainly great to be right in there with them rather than the marble palaces in downtown. We bought beer (pi jiu) from the shop next door for 2 or 3 RMB and keep them in our fridge for our return after a hard day shopping in the heat! Fabulous. Occassionally splurged and had a beer on the restaurant terrace to sit and enjoy the garden and its lighting. Got a simple but adequate haircut next door for only 10 RMB. The hotel arranged our car and driver to the Great Wall at Simitai - probably dearer than it should have been at around 600 RMB, but we couldn't be bothered trying to bargain through the official tourist agencies. Just told them the night before and it was there at 6am. Finally, the main streets nearby are mildly interesting but not hugely westernised, so don't expect a wide choice of meals at 3pm. Not a lot of shops, though the Drum Tower is very close, as is the subway and several bus routes. Take a shortcut through the hutongs to get quickly to the Hou Lake for a bit more of the hectic bars &amp; cafes, tourist shops and wonderful scenery. Overall, the Bamboo Garden was like a prize we loved to return to each day out. The serenity was a secret joy that restored and revitalised us our entire week stay.\t\n",
    "Jul 8 2007 \tShaky start great hotel\tMy first impressions of the hotel were not good - I'd booked the hotel's driver to collect me from the airport but was surprised to be asked at the hotel to pay the driver directly in cash rather than the cost being added to my hotel bill. I just had enough Chinese money with me to pay the driver. The hotel website said they offered currency exchange services so I tried to change $NZ but they wouldn't accept it, so &quot;limited currency exchange&quot; would have been more accurate - unless you have something like $US you're out of luck. The staff member I dealt with through this was not overly friendly or helpful.I had no problems from then on. The setting is great, very peaceful. I was shown to a lovely single room (411) full of character, with a fabulous bathroom and free internet access; later I booked an additional night and got a double room (416) which was just as good - no internet - but had a bit of drain smell in the bathroom - which as I later discovered you get in character hotels here as part of the package and is no problem if you close the bathroom door. The beds were the most comfortable of any I slept on during my trip.I ate a few dinners in the hotel restaurant and the food was OK - breakfast buffet just adequate - but also try the local street vendors and dumpling shops. Restaurant staff spoke very little English. I didn't try their spa; if you go left out the main gate and explore the hutongs you'll find the blind massage place - awesome - 2 mins walk. Make the most of the fabulous location.Most staff here speak limited English but are helpful. Ask them to write down your destination in characters to show taxi drivers, and also ask them to write in characters the hotel name and driving directions to it, as taxi drivers can never find it.This hotel was excellent value for money and offered a good balance between character and comfort.\t\n",
    "Jun 21 2007 \tGreat hidden gem\tWe arrived in the evening and the street you drive down is a little ominous in the dark! We asked to see the room before signing in and had a pleasant suprise. The clerk had said the room was chinese style which put us on our guard. The rooms appear to be recently remodeled. It may be Chinese style but has the western touch's of home. Flat screen TV with some english speaking stations. A nice sitting area for tea on your own private veranda overlooking the courtyard. The view to the courtyard is reminisant of a mountain scene. The staff is very friendly and wants to please. The food is good and the breakfast is western style, while lunch and dinner has the Chinese menu. This was a nice place to finish out our trip to China. &quot;AAA for the money&quot;!\t\n",
    "Jun 19 2007 \tA taste of old Beijing\tWe stayed there for 4 nights for a vacation. The best part about this hotel is its classic lush Chinese garden. Especially dining on the restaurant patio, which has a beautiful grapevine cover and a nice view of the garden. It's very relaxing to have a meal or a drink there. The hotel is not exactly comfortable, if you are used to the amenities and services of 5-star conference hotels. The bathroom is too small and they only provide couple very thin towels. The location is fairly good. It takes about 10-15 minutes to walk to the nearest subway station, which is absolutely faster and more efficient than taking a cab. Most guests are older tourists that travel in groups. Although the place is very much a novelty to foreign tourists that want a taste of old Beijing, I don't think I'll choose there again. There are plenty of old Beijing to see in the city while you are out during the day. I would rather come back to a hotel room that has comfortable bed, nice linen, and big marble bathrooms equipped with high quality shampoo and large, soft, fluffy towels....stuff Bamboo Garden does not provide. We booked a small suite with 2 twin beds for $680RMB/night, but they just increased their rate this spring. The same suite would be more than $1,000RMB.\t\n",
    "Apr 17 2007 \tGreat place to stay\tHotel was brilliant. Good location away from the real hussle and bussle of Beijing but still close enough to get to everywhere easy enough.Tube only a 5 min walk away and good links to everywhere you want to go and if not taxis were always easy to hail down.Room was nice and large and very comfortable with everything you could ask for and with a nice view over the garden. Staff were really helpfull too. If you're after a trip to the great wall we booked ours throught the Youth Hostal just round the corner and couldn't fault it.Make sure you have the hotel written in chinese symbols for when you first arrive as it is a little hard to find being in the middle of the Hutongs.Loved the hotel and love Beijing. Would stay again in an instant.\t\n",
    "Mar 5 2007 \tPerfect!\tCouldn't be better! Will go there next time for sure.Excellent location (far better than the crowded and not interesting center of the city). Flawless service (the staff helped us in every respect from arranging trips, maps &amp; directions, taxis, and even currency exchange at the bank rate)Beautiful and consistently clean rooms (the traditional chinese decor make it a great experience).No need to look for any other hotel. This one is perfect.March 3rd 2007\t\n",
    "Jan 31 2007\ta Great escape!\toh, the tea house! oh, the gardens! oh, the wild vines growing over the roof of the outdoor restaurant! we adored this place and will be staying there again when we return to china this august.we had been booked into the novotel peace hotel in beijing when we first arrived, because we were on an adoption trip and i was very paranoid about having a safe IN the room (for cash, important papers etc.). well, after two days in a hotel that was fine enough, but could have been anywhere, we switched over to the bamboo garden. just driving down that long alleyway, past hutong where people were actually still living and working as in old times (so many of these are being torn down in favor of gleaming skyscrapers as olympics 2008 approach), you just felt like you were getting a taste of the real beijing. we had hired a guide who kept us running around like crazy all day, and when we got back to the bamboo garden, it was like weight literally flew from our shoulders and we were light again. i was able to put all my important stuff in the hotel safe behind the front desk, and all was well.if you don't stay at this hotel, definitely stay at one of the other hutong hotels. they are simply beautiful and magnificient. (the beds were twin, though, a la lucy and ricky, so be prepared for that!)\t\n",
    "Oct 25 2006\tGreat place to stay!\tWe loved staying here on our vacation in October 2006. Its much more of an experience than staying at the bland Western-style hotels in Beijing. The best things about the place are the big, peaceful courtyard in the middle... the reception staff speak good English, the bar is really nice with a little waterfall in it with fish swimming around, and the location is great, 5 mins walk from the subway station. I'd really recommend using the subway. Its much less stress than having to deal with Beijing's taxi drivers. On our vacation we had two bad experiences with taxi drivers who charged us 3 times the proper price for the journey. After that we stuck to public transport and found it really easy.A few people have mentioned that the Bamboo Garden has hard beds. To be honest, we actually found them softer than a lot of the hotels we stayed at in China.There dont seem to be many travel websites where you can book rooms at this hotel, but we booked by just emailing them thru the address on their website. Its standard policy for most Chinese hotels to completely ignore any email enquiries they receive, but I found the Bamboo Garden respond to enquiries really quickly during their office hours.If I go back to Beijing I'd definately stay at the Bamboo Garden again.\t\n",
    "Oct 13 2006 \tLots of character in a nice location\tI stayed at the Bamboo Garden in early September for 4 nights. I was looking for a place with some character vs the usual 5-star properties, and Bamboo Garden fit the bill. My room was one of the standard suite rooms, with a front room containing Chinese-style furniture and a TV, and a bedroom with large (and somewhat hard) bed, new TV, and the A/C unit. The bedroom faced the front alley but was very quiet. The bathroom was small but functional and clean. There were a few issues but they didn't bother me. Your response may vary. The front room isn't the kind of place you'd want to sit and relax as the furniture is a little too severe. Some of the plaster on the walls near the bathroom was a little soft and showing signs of moisture damage. The hard bed would have been a concern if I had stayed longer, but I took sleeping pills the first few nights to help get over jet lag and really didn't notice.The best aspect of the hotel is its location in a Beijing hutong on the north side of the city. It is a 5-10 minute walk south of the Gulou subway station, down an alley off the main street. It is an old-style courtyard building, with some rooms in a newer-looking building on the inner courtyard (I didn't see these). Since it is not a 5-star hotel the prices for breakfast, Internet access, laundry, etc. are not unreasonable. The location means you are have lots of options. I ate several times at a dumpling place just down the alley from the hotel. They have an English menu probably because they are used to tourists from the hotel eating there, but mostly I saw Chinese eating there. There is a youth hostel a 5-minute walk south on the main street which has 10-yuan per hour Internet access and relatively inexpensive tours on offer. Another 5 minutes or so south is the Houhai Lake area with loads of restaurants, bars, and a few historic sights. I had a delightful day just walking around the hutongs and lakes. Being on the north side of Beijing it is relatively easy to get out to the Summer Palace and Great Wall. Taxis are cheap but traffic can make it difficult at times to reach other areas so I usually took the subway to get close and then a taxi the rest of the way.If I return to Beijing as a tourist I would stay here again. For a business trip, especially if my destination was the CBD over to the east, I would probably pick a 5-star property closer to my destination instead.\t\n",

    "Dec 24 2007 \tNice property\tWe booked a three bedroom room for $92/nite, each room came with a queen size bed. Also included was a kitchen with frig and microwave, and a washer dryer. There was also a dining area and living room, where we could sit down at night and go over all the booty collected in a days shopping. While the rooms were very spartan and lacked color, the room was very clean. The location is great and I would highly recommend this hotel to everyone, except Leon Helmsley, who would probably prefer the Astoria.\t\n",
    "Sep 15 2006 \tGreat hotel for large groups! (and individuals...)\tI traveled to Beijing in June 2006 with 6 friends and we needed an inexpensive hotel that would hold our large group. The Century Towers Beijing hotel was PERFECT. We made a reservation through www.sinohotel.com, which I was nervous about at first, not being familiar with them. The customer service reps were fantastic, responding to all my spastic e-mails quickly and with great care. When we arrived at the Hotel, we breezed through check-in and were given the same price quoted on SinoHotel.com so there were no $$ issues. We stayed in a 3-bedroom apartment-style space (the &quot;large&quot; version offered on the website), with 2 full bathrooms (American Standard fixtures) a full kitchen, and a dining room. It even included a washer/dryer in the unit, though we didn't have any need to use it. The apartment was very clean, air-conditioned, and spacious, even with the 7 of us, we had plenty of room to relax! The hotel is across the street from a HUGE supermarket, so we ended up cooking most breakfasts in the room, saving even more money! We kept lots of cold bottled water in the fridge to take with us on our adventures in the hot, dry summer weather of Beijing. The room included a large flat-screen TV in the living room with cable, and a few English-language channels like the BBC (and the Simpsons!)Other really nice aspects of the hotel include a work-out room in the basement with treadmills, stationary bikes, a rowing machine, ballet bar, free weights, and weight machines. The hotel restaurant is very small but serves good food. The wait staff (and most of China) speak very little English, so learn basic Chinese phrases and expec to smile and point a lot :) We are traveling to Shanghai in the Summer of 2007 and if Century Towers has a location there, we would absolutely stay again! I think the price is much cheaper at this hotel because it's a Chinese hotel, not a foreign chain. We paid about $85 USD/night for this large 3 bedroom apartment-style room. Between the 7 of us, the price was certainly right!\t\n",
    "Nov 4 2009 \tDisappointed\tThe hotel is out of the city centre, about 20 minutes walk to T Square. None of the taxi drivers I had knew where the hotel was - I had to show them on the map and at least 2 had to stop to ask for directions. The staff were not especially friendly or organised. The staff in the restaurant were not at all welcoming to solo travellers. For 2 nights I was sandwiched between a group of schoolgirls who spent their nights running up and down the corridor sqealing. The hotel shop is vastly overpriced - there is a grocery shop just down the road which is a lot cheaper. I'm sure there are better hotels in Beijing for the same price.\t\n",

       "\"oct nice trendy hotel location not too bad. i stayed in this hotel for one night. as this is a fairly new place some of the taxi drivers did not know where it was and/or did not want to drive there. once i have eventually arrived at the hotel, i was very pleasantly surprised with the decor of the lobby/ground floor area. it was very stylish and modern. i found the reception's staff geeting me with 'aloha' a bit out of place, but i guess they are briefed to say that to keep up the coroporate image.as i have a starwood preferred guest member, i was given a small gift upon-check in. it was only a couple of fridge magnets in a gift box, but nevertheless a nice gesture.my room was nice and roomy, there are tea and coffee facilities in each room and you get two complimentary bottles of water plus some toiletries by 'bliss'.the location is not great. it is at the last metro stop and you then need to take a taxi, but if you are not planning on going to see the historic sites in beijing, then you will be ok.i chose to have some breakfast in the hotel, which was really tasty and there was a good selection of dishes. there are a couple of computers to use in the communal area, as well as a pool table. there is also a small swimming pool and a gym area.i would definitely stay in this hotel again, but only if i did not plan to travel to central beijing, as it can take a long time. the location is ok if you plan to do a lot of shopping, as there is a big shopping centre just few minutes away from the hotel and there are plenty of eating options around, including restaurants that serve a dog meat! sep great budget hotel! stayed two nights at aloft on the most recent trip to china. the hotel was very modern and clean. the room was spotless and a comfortable king sized bed (as far as soft beds go in china). the staff was very punctual and went out of the way to help my every need, including going to a store across the street to purchase a china mobile sim card for me. the buffet breakfast was okay, nothing to write home about. the ” lcd screen had movies on demand for rmb and had a good selection of western channels including hbo, cnn, bbc, star world etc… the gym was small, had a selection of basic weights and one cable machine, there was however new technogym cardio machines with built in lcd tvs which were very good. the location is a bit out of the way to the central areas of beijing, but it is better suited for my needs as i need to be in the haidian district. being spg platinum there were no upgrades to a better room, because aloft has a policy of not doing any upgrades. the sheraton next door is a much nicer hotel in my opinion (where i am writing this from now, with an upgraded room) but as far as bang for the buck, aloft is a great place! aug excellent value - location not a big problem. we stayed at the aloft beijing haidian for nights from july - nd. there are lots of reviews that talk about the location being a problem but we knew this ahead of time and found that it really wasn't an issue. the longest we spent in a taxi was about minutes. we never paid more than rmb for a taxi ride (which is about $ cdn) and that was to the forbidden city. given there are in our family, it was no big deal at all.as for the rooms, they were clean, the beds comfortable, the wireless internet connection reliable and it was one of the few hotels we found in beijing that would accomodate adults and children. we paid about $ cdn. per night. that's an amazing price.it's not meant to be a star hotel so you can't go in expecting that. we found the reception staff generally very helpful and friendly. they aren't the fastest in the world but it wasn't unreasonable at all.the hotel manager made an effort to speak with us a few times and was extremely helpful and welcoming. their breakfast buffet was quite good and reasonably priced. there are a number of good restaurants in the four points sheraton next door so there were lots of options. there is a massive mall about a block away that has other dining options as well.the only issue we ran into was a few taxi drivers refusing to take us to the summer palace because i guess they felt it wasn't far enough. the minimum rate is rmb. but the staff at the four points sheraton (which is on a busier road than the side street for aloft) were quite helpful in finding taxis for us if they weren't already there.we would definitely stay there again and recommend it to our friends for its excellent value. jul stylish clean reasonable value poor location i am glad to be the first person to post photos of this hotel. key points about this property:- its a starwood property, much cheaper than the rest, and it shows in the pretty incompetent reception staff, the hard bed, the cheap blinds that don't quite block out the sun in the mornings, and common areas which seem to be degrading very quickly (given how new this hotel is).- on the up side, it is very clean and tidy, and if that is important to you, this hotel presents good value. it is also quite stylishly designed and looks much more modern than anything else in this price range.- location is poor for the typical tourist. yes, very poor. it is not really close to much cheaper the summer palace, and other places will require a taxi, which will probably result in hours of being frustratingly stuck in traffic. taxi drivers also dont know where it is. if coming from the east, (i.e. city centre or airport) then it is the right turn after the four points hotel, which is adjacent. if you are trying to scam an spg platinum status in the cheapest way possible, perhaps stay in these two adjacent spg hotels for nights and check out every night.on the whole i thought it was decent value, but dollar for dollar, i would personally prefer to pay double for the westin in chaoyang or financial street. i have stayed at both at approx. double the price, for real star service. but if thats not in your budget and you want the assurance of an international hotel chain, this hotel is perfect for you.lastly, this hotel may also be appropriate for university students in haidian, but don't pick this unless you know what you are doing. taxis to blcu or tsing hua may be exceptionally frustrating because of constant traffic around zhong guan cun street. tell taxi drivers to go on the four ring road, even though it might be a bit more expensive.there is free internet, but it does not seem to work with iphones. may remote but excellent value for money stayed there for one night. the hotel is located in haidian, which is a little bit remote. but if you don't mind taking the taxi to the closest subway station, which costs only - cny a ride the hotel represents excellent value for money given its low prices and the modern, quiet and very clean rooms. also internet use is for free. especially for travellors who don't want to spend the money for a hyatt or hilton but who look for a very decent place to stay this hotel represents an excellent choice. dec good value but not downtown this hotel is located next to the four points hotel and are both part of the starwood group. for those wanting a downtown location, this property may not be for you - i recommend factoring in taxi fares in and out of town when working out the value here. on the otherside, the rates for the hotel are very good and the rooms are basic but well appointed. tv was more focused on local channels which may be an indication of the clients they are targeting. there was however the standard hbo, bbc, etc. staff were very friendly and check in and check out times were acceptable. jul ??????????????????? nov great room layout service value-would definitely return we stayed in a bedroomed-suite which was well furnished and the staff perfect hosts. they even organised a birthday cake for my mum (we were all there to celebrate).could organise for massages / manicures in our suite, perfect for relaxing.located in the cbd so not great for tourists but plenty of remarkably good valued restaurants nearby. nov a quality hotel with quality service we stayed at the ascott beijing this summer for week in a family of . it is centrally located. when you are a european with kids staying for a few days it is ideal to have a fully equipped kitchen and a big wal-mart nearby. we had a modern and spacious apartment with a big lcd flat television. the service was really good and important for us not speaking the language: we never had to wait for a taxi and they always provided info for our directions.we would definitely return! oct clean rooms good location poor service check-in:my friends are i arrived from different countries @ different times and were greeted in the same lousy way. the bellboy did not help with luggage. the doorman did not open door. and the receptionist took more than minutes to greet us with no smile despite having no other guest in the lobby. in sum, not pleasant.room:we had the bedroom suite. very spacious and comfy with all basic amenities. bathroom was spacious with separate bathtub and shower area equipped with l'occitaine toiletries. but they do not provide us with new ones even tho we have finished them. we had to ask the receptionist/concierge twice before getting more toiletries to shower. the washing machine is brilliant, but the of us were not clever enough to work out how to wash and dry the days we were there. ended up doing the laundry by hand. location:central and within walking distance to the train station and food places. slight difficulty getting a taxi tho. eleven is just round the corner. and there's a starbucks on the ground floor.breakfast:small but good spread with standard egg station, fruits, breads and some local congee and hot food.massage/spa:we had massage and chinese pedicure there. pedicurist is a man who told us how maggie cheung went there for a massage a while ago. quality of massage and pedicure was average. sep amazing find for a group that wants to stick together we did a lot of searching before finally deciding to stay at the ascott in beijing. i was a bit nervous since it would be my first trip to china and i know little about the best place to stay. this ended up being the perfect choice. we had people traveling together and booked the room suite/apartment. we comfortable slept everyone. the . bathrooms worked well for our group. we also loved having a kitchen to be able to have a little choice about what we ate. we wish there would have been a grocery store closer by, although we made good use of the eleven across the street. the in-room washer and dryer were also definitely a plus and there was plenty of space for lounging around.some have complained about the internet. as far as wireless goes you can pick some up, but i wouldn't count on it. we did have wired connections though so we just shared them and made do. we weren't in china for the internet anyway so we didn't care too much.the hotel staff went above and beyond to accommodate us. i left my passport in the taxi upon arrival and the moment i told them they got right on top of tracking it down for me.for added convenience there is also a subway restaurant attached to the hotel. this may sound silly to most people, but after weeks in china i was ready to put something a bit more familiar to me in my stomach and that hit the spot. across the street you can find a chinese food restaurant that will deliver to your hotel room. we had breakfast included in our stay which was a great way to start each morning.the hotel is less than a minute walk to the subway entrance and maybe a - minute walk to the silk market and other nearby sights. all in all the hotel was very clean and the service was great. it is a wonderful deal for how nice the accommodations are and i would highly recommend it to anyone. sep good value for large family - internet connection prob not hotel's fault great for large families! we grabbed a large bedroom for adults and kids. great room - my chinese inlaws really liked the kitchen and washer/dryer. big thumbs up from them. large lcd tv was also in heavy rotation. had a nice kids movie with popcorn and the works every friday. internet was down for several days (the hotel's guest room isp had an issue), however the gm allowed us use of the conference center internet which was a different isp as soon as he was aware. prob solved. if you are looking for casa mia, it closed, however annie's italian is opening soon right across the street. i've never tried casa mia but annie's is a great chain with excellent service, good value, great food. also tried the subway and curry rest in the building all fine. gym facilities were awesome - full cybex, freeweights and treadmills with lcds. the breakfast buffet actually improved during our stay, and we were asked for ideas to make it better. the kids room is more oriented towards toddlers - small ball pit and other basic toys. and yo with us enjoyed the pool more - decent temps and very clean. if you stay here, learn how to get to walmart, its faster to walk than taxi, and they have all of the essentials at good prices. everybody bought a lot of our local food souveniers there. the main lacking of this hotel is that it's not a tourist hotel. you'll have to do most of the homework on your own. find a local guide and hire them like we did. aug don't rely on it if you have any mission-critical deals to seal the internet connection was not reliable at all. i was not able to connect to my us stock/futures broker to view/trade the markets. couldn't login to my airline to do an internet check in or book my seat. other websites such as yahoo, msn messenger service were inacessible as well. the front desk tried it as well and they have no clue and no answer how to fix it. the bed rooms were generally big and well equipped. had a dryer/washing machine,safe with no instructions, tv in the living room was an lcd, tv in the room was a grainy crt breakfast was lousy. spread was limited and tilted towards awfuloverall - a horrible experience. internet connection should be as essential water in the toilet . if like me you need a steady and reliable connection, avoid this place. aug best place in beijing i travel a lot in beijing, i've stayed in different hotel and serviced apartment and honestly this one is the best one i ever stayed. the staff is always friendly and try there best to satisfied each of your request.there is a starbucks, a minimart and several restaurant in house, each of them can deliver food in your apartment. there is also a massage center, you can phone them and order a massage in your room.the room are just awesome, you will have more place that you never had in any hotel or even serviced apartment, the smallest room is around square meter, i always stay in a bedroom around square meter and i always feel like at home away from home.the staff and the management are really helpfull, i really apreciate the way guest are treated.of course i recommend this residence for family our group, but it will be suitable for people who like space and great facilities. aug we loved it! we stayed at the ascott for nights, and were extremely happy with the facilities and rooms. the apartment was very large and spacious for our family of and is perfect for families or couples as there are bedrooms ( with a king bed, the other with a double or queen) and well equipped bathrooms. the kitchen had all the utensils and dishes you needed. we did not cook but bought groceries and had breakfast and snacks at the hotel. there was even a washer and they provided packets of soap. we used the gorgeous pool area everday and there is also a steamroom and sauna. we were on a private tour so we didn't venture out of the hotel on our own but we always seemed to be about minutes from the main attractions in beijing. there is a subway and bank machine right in the hotel. we'd recommed this hotel to anyone! jul nice apartment stayed for nights in a bedroom. it's a home away from home. nice apartment except for the laundry problem mentioned in the previous post. after waiting hours for the first load, i learned my lesson. don't want to spend my vacation time doing laundry, you know. since it's a small capacity washer and dryer (loads about pieces of clothing), i just selected what needs to be washed and choose the shortest wash time with about minutes of drying time. that way clothes are dry not damp. do be aware that your white clothes may be stained with yellow stains, probably from the water. at least that's what my beijing friends told me. location wise, it's a liitle farther from most of the sights. as far as taxi drivers unable to find the location of this apartment, i think it's a common problem for travellers to beijing. i think the taxi drivers in beijing are notorious at overcharging visitors. i've paid between rmb to rmb on different occasions travelling from ascott to wangfujing street and vice versa. taxi drivers in beijing are not trustworthy. from my own experience, i can tell that it's a trick for the drivers to tell the passengers that they are not familiar with a location and they would have to make phone calls to verify. then, they would start cruising around while the charges keep going up. this happens to me about out of times i took a taxi anywhere. it's a huge problem and i speak their language. imagine someone who doesn't. overall, i would recommend this apartment to families only. there're better places to stay in beijing if you are single or a couple. jul avoid it if you are planning to do your own laundry at this place stay here for nights with my family after reading previous positive reviews on trip advisor, the travel channel (beijing special with samatha brown), and friends. the only good thing i can say is the roominess of the place(we stayed in the bedroom) and the fairly good value you get for your money. otherwise i say avoid it! services were extremely slow due to understaffing (i think on purposes by the management despite low cost of labor in beijing). waits of minutes to an hour was the norm with each calls for housekeeping or repair crew to come by. can't stand the poor quality of the combination washer/dryer unit inside the apartment. it takes at least - hours to do a load of laundry (wash &amp; dry) and the clothes still come out damp to wet. have complaint to management a few times but best they can do is apologize. if you are planning to do sightseeing in beijing (which we did for a few days), where do you even find time to spend this much time on doing laundry( and still get upset with the damp/wet cloths). breakfast was very greasy for the chinese items and western breakfast items were few and skimpy. would definitely not stay here again despite all the hype, location was not easy to find (taxi drivers had a hard time locating it, and had to call the hotel to get directions). faucets on basins/tubs were hard to reach if you had to wash something (if you see them, you would know what i am talking about). avoid! jun great value and excellent choice for family with children although the casa mia restaurant has closed, ascott beijing still serves well for families with children (since it's a serviced apt). it has a gym, a pool and a play room (for young children). the location is also quite central (next to park hyatt) - highly recommended for families! apr ideal for a family or a larger group i spent six nights in a bedroom apartment at the ascott with five of my family members.pros: fully equipped kitchen and laundry. spacious living/dining area. free internet access. beautiful swimming pool/jacuzzi. sauna and steam. spacious gym with new equipments. well-situated - currency exchange at the desk, mini-market/citibank atm/massage shop on the premises, good chinese restaurant just across the street. for grocery shopping, minute walk to a - convenience store, and about minute walk to a wal-mart. about minute walk to the guo mao subway and bus station (be careful when you cross the road). taxis are available at the hotel entrance. have your destinations printed in chinese, when you take taxis.cons: i have no complain but one. while the housekeepers were polite and seemed earnest, the service was not up to par with what i had expected. the master bedroom and bathroom were left unclean one day. the towels and amenities (shower gel, shampoo, bathroom glasses, toilet papers, and so on) were not enough; we only had four sets of towels for six people and had to keep asking for more during the first , days. but those were not a big deal for us anyway. just keep in mind that this is a serviced apartment mainly for long-stay expats, not really a hotel.overall, i think the ascott is one of the best options for a family or larger group. mar excellent hotel for a family this hotel is perfect for a family staying in beiijing. the rooms are like apartments - fully equipped kitchen and laundry. spacious living/dining area. we stayed in a bedroom suite. the rooms were large and bright. the room is cleaned daily. overall, very clean except some carpet stains. the location of the hotel is not bad. it is located at guo mao, the cbd of beijing. convenient for business trips. however, do not be tricked by the fact that it appears close to guo mao subway station. although the hotel is situated practically on the guo mao intersection ( rd ring road and jian guo road), the subway station is not near. the guo mao intersection is absolutely massive - the subway station is across the road at the south-west corner while the hotel is at the south-east corner. to cross the road you must follow the crowd - beijing drivers and pedestrians are absolutely crazy compared to north american standards. however, they are very skilled drivers. it takes approximately minutes to get from the hotel to the subway station.subways in beijing are very busy. if you take the subway during rush hour (morning and evening), prepare to be packed like a sardine. having said that, the subway is beautiful, frequent, and effecient. you can get practically anywhere in beijing with rmb. you can also take public buses - very easy and cheap. only rmb cash fare. there are hundreds of bus lines that will take you anywhere you want. for long buses, get on at the middle door. there will be a fare collector on the left. for short buses, get on at the front, the bus driver has a machine to collect money. taxis are everywhere in beijing. but beware - even registered and official drivers will rip you off. although taxis are very cheap compared to north america, drivers, seeing that you are not native, will trick you. know how much the trip should cost, hold a map, make sure the driver doesn't make stupid turns. you will waste time and money if the driver tricks you. but even if you do know where you are going, the driver will simply ignore your advice and continue. beware. never take taxis during rush hour, especially on streets like changan and jian guo. it will take forever and make you frustrated. the hotel's amenities are very good. there is a computer for use in the lobby area (ask reception) and there is wifi in the lobby. there is a beautiful swimming pool/hot tub too. sauna and steam is also available. a gym is also available.as for food, beijing food is very cheap. you can eat out. but if you wish to cook, you can take the hotel shuttle to supermarkets. there is also a convenient - across the street where you can buy snacks.overall very good hotel. jan perfect for families me, my husband and two sons ( and ) stayed at the ascott beijing for nine nights. very convenient location close to a main subway line. definately have the address printed in chinese when you come from airport as it is tucked down a side street. driver may call hotel for direction but no problem. taxis in front of hotel were pleniful. nice security and we always felt safe. a couple of restaurants, teahouses and starbucks in the complex as well as a massage place (not too good), a convenience store for milk, yogurts, cereal, pasta, soda, etc. all very convenient. excellent italian restaurant onsite called casa mia. this proved invaluable when travelling with two american kids who are fickle eaters. owner is from italy and food is good and reasonably priced. fresh mozzeralla pizza was great (about $ . us). my husband enjoyed the lasagna. they will deliver up to your room which is great after a day of touring with two very tired kids. my husband and i actually went to the restaurant and ate alone while we had an order sent up to the kids in the apartment. we had a two bedroom . bathroom apartment. very spacious and clean. large kitchen and master bathroom were wonderful. housekeeping was excellent. very small clothes washer/dryer but enough for a vacation. pool and fitness area were also excellent. most of the time we had the pool to ourselves and there were always plenty of clean towels. good staff at the desk. nov choice for western visitors i stayed at the ascott from october - , . we arrived in beijing late in the evening after a day of flying. just as previously written, the taxi driver had some diffiiculty locating the hotel. we brought along the phone number. the taxi driver called and got directions. we booked a two bedroom and it was a very comfortable and nice room. the room was large and had a full kitchen, laundry room, dining room and living area. the hotel is about a ten minute walk to the nearest subway although we used taxi most of the time. they are cheap. the hotel was very helpful in establishing taxi fees up front and coordinating out trip to badaling. most of the front desk staff speaks very good english. we ate at the italian restaurant in the hotel one evening and it was very good although the waitress was a litle hesitant with her english. the owner/chef was italian and vey helpful. there is a starbucks and convenience store in the hotel. the breakfast was good and they had a wide variety of foods to pick from.besides the pearl and silk markets, i enjoyed the in room massage the best. we had massages in the shop downstairs and noticed they will come to room for massage service for the same price. after a day of shopping and sightseeing this came in handy. for yuan or about $ . , we had private massages in the room for one hour. it was so relaxing. overall, a pleasant stay. nov very good place for family vacations we booked a bedrooms suite through hotels.com for a stay in end october and were wery happy with this hotel.it was a key success factor of our vacations in beijing.our two young kids ( and ) had a large space in the living room to play, and thanks to the kitchen, we were able to prepare them the breakfast they liked.the washing machine was very useful, and despite the fact that the program were written in chinese.we used to get food delivered at the room from the italian and japanese restaurant that are located in the same building : it was very good and cheap, and much convenient for our tired kids.we used the convenience store of the hotel and the / to buy complementary food, such as yoghort.the swimming pool was great and clean.the location is very convenient. we rarely used the subway, as the travel time by taxi was shortened, due to the fact that traffic regulations to imit traffic were still in force. it took us only minutes to go to the summer palace at h !!we even finally extended our stay. the people at the front desk were very honest, recommanding us to book through hotels.com, but as were was no more availability on the web site, we finally booked directly with the hotel.as far as we could see, this hotel is located at minutes by walk of a wall mart.a very good place to recomend to all families. sep really good alternative accomodation in beijing my friends and i stayed at this apartment hotel which is nicely located near a metro stop, guomao, in the chaoyang district. the room/apartment was two bedrooms a large living room and full kitchen with a modest size laundry room. though the washing machine did not work. this was great for our short stay and would have been even better if we were there for a week. the front desk works just as any hotel in the ability to book tours, change currency, and get transport. a, - computer, business center, with free access is also available as well as two restaurants in the building, a subway, and a citibank atm. if you decide that you actually prefer to eat in the apartment rather than the restaurants there is a - down the block where you can get fixings to make an omelet for breakfast. two issues:* for some reason the cab drivers have a really hard time finding this hotel so if you use it make sure to have not only the address but the phone number. every cab ride we had to have the cabbie call the hotel despite them having the card with the address (in chinese) to get the directions. cabbies are willing to make the call.* second was the cab con that we had at our departure. after booking for a cab the night before for a : am pick up to the airport for y we woke up to find out that the cabbies suddenly wanted y because it was early and it was raining. bs, and this was something the concierge was pushing. and then they wanted to push it to two cabbies because of our luggage and wanted to be paid before we left. hey i'm from nyc. no money up front, got to the airport and paid y and we also did not agree to pay the y toll though we did have to do it with two cabs. i blame the hotel because i saw the concierge take his&quot;cut&quot; from the cabbies before we left. aug great family hotel this is a great hotel for a family. our family of five booked the two bedroom/two bath suite for two weeks. it was beautiful - marble kitchen and bathrooms. it had a large dining and living area. it even had a washer/dryer. housekeeping came daily and thoroughly cleaned our room. the gym was nice and the pool was huge. we could find a taxi easily and it is located in a nice neighborhood. the staff was also friendly. jun excellent in every respect i stayed at the ascott for nights in april this year. my stay there was excellent, in every respect:* check-in: fast, efficient, and i was upgraded to a huge -bedroom, -bath apartment (see photos), it must have been square meters.* location: very convenient, in cbd chaoyang, meters on a back road from jianguomen dajie (it is basically right behind the motorola tower, any beijinger will know where that is), meters from the guo mao subway station on the third ring road, meters from the china world trade ctr. there are taxis almost always outside the hotel.room: very spacious, clean, fully-equipped kitchen, separate laundry room(!), l'occitane toiletries in the bathrooms, lcd tvs, ample closet spaces.* on-site facilities: everything you'll need: - restaurants leasing space from the hotel: thai, japanese, italian, starbucks...i had food delivered to my room from the italian restaurant, very good and fast.there is a mini-market on the premises with everything you might need for a short stay, a citibank atm on the premises(!), and a -minute walk. great gym, huge, with nice views, looked newly renovated, new equipment, and it was empty every time i went there.i believe the pool was closed for renovation, so no opinion on that.service: one word: excellent. example: i'd call housecleaning right before i'd go downstairs to the gym so they come to clean the room, i come back from the gym hour later and the apartment is made up and the cleaning lady is ready to leave! in other words, immediate housekeeping on request.tip at the beijing airport: have with you the address of your hotel in chinese, or at least the phone number, so the taxi driver can call them to get the address. may recommended with one strong consideration i found the comments here to be generally true when i arrived at this hotel with my husband and toddler. the rooms are huge and well-appointed. the grocery store downstairs, though small, contains many western foods which can be difficult to find otherwise as does the reasonable lobby restaurant. however, my husband has a bad lower back and the bed was intolerable for him. generally speaking, hotel beds are better for him but this is basically a thick futon. i thought it felt like sleeping on a hay bale. the hotel (after calls and one direct chat with the guest services director) switched out the mattress to something they said was softer, but it was basically the same. we had to pack up and relocate after the first night. we are both in our late s and not that out of shape! also, the pool which i specifically picked for the toddler was closed. and the staff is rather limited on english, but that seems typical in beijing. nov excellent choice for beijing i stayed at the ascott beijing for two months during sep / oct . rooms were spacious and generally well maintained. of the three rooms i stayed in i only had issues with one, which were resolved without fuss.i had previously stayed at a star hotel in beijing, and the ascott provided larger, better furnished rooms at a cheaper rate. the building housing the ascott includes a number of restaurants and shops (thai, japanese, chinese, italian, starbucks, subway, a hour convenience store, an atm, ...).large pool and gym with new equipment. reception staff generally speak good english but other staff do not (this is standard for china). only issue would be that i didn't find the buffet breakfast fantastic (but i am quite fussy). nov didn't want to leave! we rented a two bedroom deluxe apartment using the hotel's website it came to about $ . one of the rooms was a master bedroom, the other a regular bedroom with the bathroom across the hall (great for a family, might be an issue for two couples). the apartment had a full kitchen and a laundry room with a washer/dryer (small loads work best).the apartment was large, it was well lit and felt very luxurious.when we arrived the room was still being cleaned by a small army of maids so we spent some time at the starbucks downstairs reading the free and very useful time out beijing and that's beijing papers. forget about guide books, they are obsolete the moment they are published in fast changing china.the hotel's rooms are in two towers (east and west) which you can access using your room card. you also use your room card to activate the elevator. this felt very safe. there are a few restaurants, a couple of art galleries, a massage place, a convenience store and a very neat tea house in the same building.breakfast is served in the nearby casa mia italian restaurant. the website called it a continental breakfast, but it's much more than that. there are eggs, noodles, congee, vegetables, in addition to the more usual muffins and cereal.i found the staff to be very friendly and helpful. problems like missing toiletries and a leaky fridge were taken care of right away. i would recommend a stay here to anyone who's traveling in larger groups.the hotel provides internet access for an extra fee and can arrange excursions and airport transfers for you, but those are usually more expensive then doing it yourself (about twice as expensive). the guomao subway stop is close by and can get you to tianamen square and the forbidden city very easily. taxis were always available.the airport shuttles get you pretty close to the hotel (take # and the stop is # - guomao). it's only yuan, but not very comfortable. a taxi will cost about - yuan and is probably a better option. the airport staff is completely unhelpful and will try to sell you on tours to the great wall and expensive shuttle services ( - times what it would cost by taxi). of course all this might change with the olympics. hopefully for the better. sep absolutely delighted with this hotel! i wasn't looking for an apartment - just somewhere i could fit adults and kids without having to pay for hotel rooms. we paid the special rate of rmb nightly for the ascott beijing, booked on the ascott website. the location was very good - you could walk to shops &amp; restaurants, or it was easy to get a taxi. the silk market was walking distance.the apartment itself was divine - one of the nicest i have ever stayed in. it had two bedrooms, two bathrooms, full kitchen &amp; laundry. it's obviously set up for expats who stay long term. after the tiny room we had in shanghai, this was an absolute delight. we arrived early and paid an extra half day to check into our room early. then it seemed a pity to leave it for the next five days, but clearly we did because we managed to cover its expansive spaces with shopping. apr ok - but service can be frustrating my family (wife, kids, in-laws) spent four nights in a br apartment at the ascott in beijing. the room was decent, although clearly fraying around the edges with worn carpet. the room is in need of updating. quite inexcusably, we were put in a br apartment in a wing of the hotel where the other apts. were being renovated. so during the day we had workmen walking up and down the halls and we returned each day to the smell of fresh paint in the area.the biggest problem is that the service is not up to par. for example, when we checked in, we only had sets of towels in a br apartment that sleeps at least people. not sure if they think you're going to take turns or something. when we asked for more towels, they brought two sets up and asked us to sign for them (never had that happen in a hotel). when we asked for some additional sets (we like to have extras on hand), both on-duty housekeepers came up and told us we more than enough towels and that we could exchange towels, not get additional sets. at one point, they accused us of wanting to steal the towels.after engaging the front desk, we finally got a few extra sets of towels, but it clearly wasn't worth the hassle. we had other minor problems throughout the stay. while we enjoyed the extra space, the kitchen and laundry facilities and the price was relatively inexpensive, in some ways it was more hassle than it was worth. nov good value but watch the beds! the ascott beijing is perfect for those wanting to stay in a service apartment in the city, and for the added space you pay hardly anymore than for a hotel room. the ascott is well appointed with large rooms and comfortable open spaces. it is also well situated in the guo mao area with a line of taxis behind for easy travel (easy being relative because as soon as you leave the hotel by taxi you enter the city's increasingly horrid traffic).the ascott also had an indoor pool which is useful in the cooler months and a good gym. there is even a massage centre right down stairs (not run by the hotel but they are permitted to go to your room).the only issue - albeit an important one - i had with the ascott beijing was the quality of their beds - they were were just too hard. and when i say hard its not a matter of too firm, but actually too hard! you don't feel like you are getting any support which leads to unfulfilling sleep. for a service residence of this caliber this is certainly a disappointment and a reason why i may consider staying at the ascott beijing again. my rating for the hotel would otherwise be a &quot; &quot; or excellent. oct want a convenient alternative to a star beijing hotel? traveling to china four times annually since year and staying at and star rated hotels in beijing, i tried the ascott in as an alternative. the ascott provides the leisure and business traveler a refreshing alternative with the bonus of twice the floor space of a western style hotel suite. another attraction is the ascott's location. it is situated in the most desireable area of beijing known as choyang or the central business district where the center of government, shopping, and branded hotels are domiciled. the ascott may not have the name recognition of the western chains...yet; but if you need high speed internet, a convenient location, english speaking staff, and a spacious accomodation, you will be pleasantly surprised with this hidden jewel. jul pretty nice place i just stayed at the ascott with seven of my family members in june , and we all thought that it was pretty nice. this is not really a hotel; it's a serviced apartment. so, it is meant to be used long-term by business travelers. the benefit for short-term travlers is that the ascott has several different apartment configurations, and it is one of the few options in beijing (that i know of) where larger groups can stay comfortably. we rented two apartments, each of which had two bedrooms and two bathrooms ( y a night). the apartments were tastefully decorated with full kitchens (granite countertops, stainless appliances, etc.). the service was very good, and the location is convenient -- behind the motorola building on the intersection of jianguomen and third ring road, kitty corner from the world trade hotel and the guomao subway station. there's a starbucks in the same building, and there are several places to eat. a minsheng bank is located right across the street from the lobby, which has an atm machine that takes all the cards, and there is a - about yards down the street -- nice when you need cold beer or water at all hours of the night.like many other properties in china, the quality of workmanship in the hotel rooms leaves something to be desired -- uneven grout lines, messy caulking, etc. if you've stayed at other hotels in china, you know exactly what i mean. this would be my one reservation about the place, but it didn't seem to bother people in our group. in other words, it's not a five-star hotel, but it's trying hard. the place still provides one of the best options for larger groups of people (on this, i agree with the earlier poster.). if you're interested, you can find photos online at the ascott's website, which provide a reliable idea about how the apartments look. nov fantastic apartments my family recently returned from a day tour in china - our days at the ascott beijing made for a fantastic finale. we got all the creature comforts of a hotel (nice furnishings, linens and maid service) combined with the privacy and space of a large apartment.we were a mixed group: two grandparents, three grandsons ( , , and yrs old), their mom and me (the auntie). after days in hotels and staying in separate hotel rooms - with frequent calling between rooms to get organized for breakfast, dinner, etc - this luxurious apartment set up was a welcome change (and about the same price). our bedroom, . bathroom apartment seemed new and extremely clean. there was a washer/dryer combo, but it was so slow that it was just better to send our laundry out to a service. the kitchen was well appointed &amp; we could easily prepare our meals - the maid service helped finish up the dishes we inevitably left behind each morning.for the kids, the big pool and hot tub were a blast - a much needed energy release every day. very clean &amp; pretty with big towels. for younger children there is a babypool, a playroom and for adults a nice gym.the breakfast buffet that came with our room rate was not all that great, but we went a couple times anyway. plus, it was fun to see some of the ex-pat families that basically live at the ascott.the location was pretty good, with a nice 'western' style market within walking distance. i would highly recommend this hotel/apartment building for travelling families or groups. it was so much easier to communicate and coordinate, that we were more relaxed for the touring (and dealing with the terrible beijing traffic). very nice hotel we get vacation every year after my wedding. but up to now more than four years we work hard and prepare for great vacation for months we choose asia is our destination first stop in beijing we stayed in this hotel.hotel not too big but the room was nice and comfortable. we liked this and enjoyed it. nov a fantastic hotel my boyfriend and i stayed in the autumn garden hotel at the end of our trans-siberian railway trip from moscow and staying there was one of the highlights of an amazing holiday. staying in the hutong was so much better than an international style hotel, we really felt that we experienced a 'real' bit of beijing. we loved the choice of english or chinese breakfasts, the room was gorgeous and having free internet was incredibly useful. the location was wonderful too, only minutes walk to tiananmen square. sep nice place to stay the staff are extremely helpful and friendly, enabling you to find your bearings by providing a trishaw facility to the main road from the hotel. the location of the hotel is a minute walk from qianmen subway and the furnishings of the hotel rich in tradition. you may not get the western breakfasts you do in more modern hotels but it gives you an opportunity to live like the locals. dec reccomended this is a great little hotel, i booked this hotel based on previous reviews, so i thought i would come on here and recommend it myself.i went to beijing on my own for nights to see what its like. it is quite a crazy place, chinese people seem to take advantage of tourists at every possible opportunity.the autumn garden hotel however is amazing, such nice people, and i consider it a great price for what i got. its location is great if you want to get a slight feel of what its like living in china.you need to walk down a couple of narrow alley ways to get to the hotel, but it is very close to tienanmen square, with a lot of sites close by, such as the temple of heaven and forbidden city within walking distance. also there is a touring company with nice and cheap tours (although in chinese) which is less than minutes walk away next to tienanmen square.the rooms are clean and comfortable. breakfast is simple but decent. the people are fantastic, talk english and are very very helpful. they picked me up from the airport without any charge, im not sure if this is a regular service, but it was helpful. if it is your first time in china, i recommend getting picked up, as taxi drivers talk very little english if any at all, and the hotel can be hard to find, taxi drivers wont know it.the hotel welcomes you very nicely, and give you a map to the area and to the hotel, and even a mobile phone to use while you stay with them.the hotel had everything you should need, but i was truly impressed by the service there which easily allows me to recommend it. in contrast to most of the chinese which i met who seemed to try and take me for every cent that i had, this little hotel was there for me for every need, without trying to charge me for the help that they offered, or even the things which i expected to pay for such as the half a day late checkout, or airport pick up.if you want a simple, relaxing, and friendly stay, try the autumn garden. i will no doubt be staying there again on my next visit. nov an oasis in beijing just got back from beijing and a wonderful experience staying in the middle of a hutong (maze of alleyways) in beijing, just next door to tian'anmen square. this inn is truly an oasis in a crazy busy city and right in the middle of what feels like years ago - staff were so welcoming and accomodating - if you want a taxi, they have one - we went to the great wall with our very own driver - even had a (very simple) lunch prepared by one of the staff - who were all delightful - lovely courtyard - very quiet even though in the midst of chaos - a real feel for old china - haven't downloaded our photos yet, but willing to share if anyone is interested! nov lovely traditional style hotel this is a really lovely traditional style hotel, located literally just minutes walk away from tianmen square as well as lots of eating options &amp; shops. the girls at the front desk were very friendly, helpful and spoke good english. the rooms are very pretty and comfortable, with modern western style bathrooms. since it's located in the hutong (lots of narrow, confusing alley ways) it's a good idea to take with you the address of the hotel writen in chinese characters as well as the phone number, so the taxi driver can call for directions. we were given a mobile to use during our stay - and took it with us when we went off to north korea for a week and then called when we got back, and they sent out a car to pick us up from the station. on our return we also got upgraded to a bigger room. the bathrooms were pretty much the same in both rooms - the sinks make a brilliant nose when you tap them. i booked, as i usually do, on www.venere.com - this is an excellent website and no down payment required. aug living it the beijing way as i was looking for accommodation for my visit during the olympics in late , most of the major hotels were not available for booking for ioc-related room blocks. which means when i booked it everything everywhere was very expensive. then i found this little courtyard hotel, and was charged at least times their published rates, yet still i am happy with what i got. situated &quot;layers&quot; deep from the main streets, you will either need to have good map reading skills to navigate your way to find this on your own... or you could use their free tricycle service which would pick you up from either qianmen or hepingmen quanjude roast duck restaurant.i love the surrounding of this guesthouse. it is a typical hutong where houses are one next to the other, and rather peaceful and quiet. that means it's not the best place to stay if you are expecting upper class and polished streets. in fact, you will find at least smelly public toilets along the way to the guesthouse. but that's what's genuine about the neighbourhood. the location is also quite fantastic... a - minute walk (or less with tricycle) would bring you to the subway station (hepingmen and qianmen), and also tiananmen square... that's a big plus for those who like to travel the local way (on foot or subway).rooms are not big, but adequate, with modern bathroom amenities (good and strong hot showers!). room rates include free use of internet and breakfast (chinese or western style, pick whatever you want).you cannot reach this place by taxi, so be ready to have a little hassle when you arrive and depart. the tricycle rider is friendly and could get you to the main streets. i arrived in a chauffeured car and the driver had no clue where it was and luckily i did my research and found the property myself. although i paid the rate for a -star hotel, i wouldn't have done it any other way. oct a hidden gem we stayed at this hotel for nights at the start of our holiday and again for nights before returning to the uk. we chose this hotel as a change from the main chain hotels in beijing which we have stayed in on previous visits.this is a lovely hotel within reasonable walking distance, through the hutongs, to the lakes houhai &amp; quanhai. the metro line is a short walk from the hotel and taxis are cheap and plentiful on the main road near to the hotel.despite being in a very busy part of beijing the hotel is exceptionally quite and peaceful. we had a suite on the ground floor (room ). the bed was giantic but, as with most chinese beds, quite hard. the pillows were the best pillows i have ever slept on and the linen was spotlessly clean as were the rooms.the lounge room furntiure was classical chinese carved wood, gorgeous to look at but not the most comfortable to sit on. we had a computer in the room with free internet acess which was a bonus. the rooms and the bathroom were spotless. due to the position of our room there was not a lot of natural light.breakfast was included in our deal and was ok. the main problem was that some of the food was not hot, in fact somtimes not even warm. that said there was a very good variety and the staff were helpful and friendly.all the staff were very helpful and we would highly recommend this hotel to anyone who doesn't wish to stay in a tall, concrete block where every room is the same. sep all we were hoping for was there i booked this hotel based on the reviews i read on tripadvisor and i found everything i was looking for. the place is beautiful, clean and ideally located, close to the subway (which is very easy to use and gets you quickly anywhere in the city center) and to a number of lovely little restaurants where you can enjoy amazing dinners for less than dollars. the staff is helpful and the frontdesk service impeccable: all of them proved to be attentive and exceedingly kind ( they helped us book restaurants and wrote directions in chinese for us to show in case we got lost). besides you get a very good exchange rate for your currency (much better than the one you get at the airport). we also booked from them a taxi service from the airport to the hotel. it wasn't cheap ( yuan when you would usually pay ) but we were extremely pleased with it. the driver met us at the arrival gate and we managed to check in without any problem minutes after claiming our luggage - which is good after a -hour-long flight. the hutong location is fascinating and absolutely safe. we tried the dumplings place next door recommended by one of the reviewers. it doesn't look very inviting from the outside (the decor is indeed basic) but it is always packed with locals for a good reason: the food is delicious (expect to pay around dollars for your meal).the computer (with free broadband internet) available in every rooms is also very useful. aug great value for money excellent room with own computer, great location close to sights, breakfast not great, service okay. jul excellent character hotel we were delighted with this choice of hotel. it’s situated down a hutong and takes you by surprise on approach. the road is a bit scruffy but don’t let that put you off. the hotel is a quiet oasis and a short walk from lots of restaurants and the old bell and drum towers. the reception staff were friendly (in contrast to some reports that i’d read) and spoke good english. the hotel buildings are set around a tranquil courtyard. the bedrooms are a good size and decorated in chinese style. there was a huge, comfortable bed. the room was very clean with a nice bathroom and a good shower. there was even a pc in the room for free internet access! the air conditioning worked although i would have liked it to be a little cooler.the breakfast buffet was decent and had enough western food. we ate at the hotel one evening and found it to be very good value.we found it easy to navigate our way to this hotel as it is on the edge of the hutongs.i would definitely stay here again. jul courtyard hotel in the hutongs we stayed in a deluxe suite for the first several nights of our honeymoon. the room was very large with a bedroom, sitting room and . bathrooms. the bathrooms were large, modern and clean. the bed was very comfortable with a wooden canopy and red silk bed spread. there was a mini bar, a huge flat screen television and (huge bonus) a computer with free internet access. the staff were polite and even kept the restaurant open for us when we arrived minutes before closing. the food in the restaurant for dinner and breakfast was average but i would recommend going outside the hotel for meals, especially down to the houhai lake area. we rented bikes from the hotel which was an adventurous experience. the only negative was the construction just outside the hotel on the road. since the hotel is in the hutongs, the road was very narrow and we had to walk through the muddy construction to the main road to get a taxi. this hotel is a / minute walk north of the drum tower/houhai lake area. jun lovely boutique hotel with good service this hotel had character...genuine chinese decor which was very pleasing, and a large campus, which we did not explore fully. the restaurant was very good, and everything we ate was well prepared and reasonably priced.there was always someone at the front desk who spoke excellent english, so there was never any problems of communication. the exchange rate offered for currency conversion was also very good. on request, they arranged airport pickup for rmb, which was a bit on the high side, but efficiently arranged (we managed the return airport trip in rmb quite easily by another taxi).they also arranged a taxi for the great wall for rmb, which again was slightly on the high side. we tried doing some flight bookings through their travel agent, but his quotes were very high; found much better rates on ctrip. my only complaint is that the hotel seems to be trying to make too much money on the side by padding up taxi rates, travel agent fees etc.their website says that they have a laundry room. i presumed that meant we could use the services of a washing machine/dryer. that is not true. they offer laundry services at prohibitive &quot;per piece&quot; rates, so beware.location is central, but about a minute walk from the golou metro stop. wish it was a little closer. right in the middle of the &quot;hutong&quot; neighborhood though.overall good value for money in beijing. good rooms, decent prices, and overall quite comfortable. oh yes, the free computer terminal in the room with internet was a big plus. may a peacefull place in a very busy city we booked a few nights in this hotel after our trip on the transmongolia express. our travelagent tipped us and she didn't lie: bamboo garden is a beautiful hotel. it is in one of the socalled hutongs and it is extremely peacefull. and that is what you need after spending a day in busy beijing. the staff is nice and helpfull, the rooms are very spacious, nicely decorated and fully equiped. closeby are good restaurants and bars, shops, one of beijings lakes.... even within walking distance.there is a computer with internet (ofcourse, so the government can keep an eye on things) in your room, which is very usefull.we had a very pleasant stay! apr excellent hotel this was my second stay at the hotel - the first was in - and the hotel has only got better since. rooms are beautiful and have tv and a computer with internet access.the bathrooms are well equipped and the shower was brlliant.the hotel is very peaceful and is located in the hutong not far from shops, bars and restaurants. the hotel restaurant serves lovely food at very reasonable prices - around £ for a main dish. i have recommended this hotel to everyone i know who has travelled to beijing and everyone has raved about it. mar the very best this was just a wonderful experience staying at this hotel.the experience did not start out well as i arrived at night and the taxi driver could not locate the lane that the hotel is situated in. when the lane was found it was blocked by a truck and car so we had to walk with our luggage the last part of the lane.this was the only negative to our stay.this is a small hotel in a historic building. the room was excellentwith modern facilities looking out onto spacious gardens.all of the staff were very attentive and spoke very good english. front office was very helpful and quickly attended to onward bookings, money changingand sightseeing suggestions etc.the only meals that i had at the hotel was breakfasts and these were excellent, freshly cooked eggs and bacon and a wide selection of both chinese and western foods.the location of the hotel is great with a great number of restaurants very close by. a must try is the le little saigon which is very close by and is an excellent restaurant providing both french and vietnamese dishes.nearby are both subway, bus and many taxis.it is convenient to many local attractions including the forbidden city. a walk to the nearby lake is a must.this hotel is truly a hidden gem and i will return. mar very convenient location for business! we stayed in this hotel for nights on business in beijing. we love the hotel's location because it's very convenient for us in business or appointment with our dealers. moreover, staff were very helpful during our staying.highly recommended this hotel to everyone. feb decent hotel i stayed here for nights in late november . the room i wanted was actually booked so they put me in a suite for the same price prior to my arrival. the suite came with a computer which included free internet access as well as free water. service was average but being close to the subway was a plus. felt safe in the area although the alley to the hotel gets dark at night. this isn't a &quot;must stay at&quot; hotel by any stretch so feel free to scout out other places. feb awesome rooms great hotel grounds helpful staff dumplings! when we passed the dumpling house and little &quot;bodega&quot; before entering the hotel grounds we knew we were in for a treat! free internet was a delightful treat after being in morocco, india, and egypt the month before. the beds were super comfortable, very very clean room with a nice view of the courtyard. the grounds themselves were an &quot;oasis&quot; in the middle of this sprawling city. had no trouble getting a cab to hike the great wall. there's a cool commercial district with shops and restaurants within walking distance (go to the right out of the little alleyway on the main street and down about mins). oh yeah, the dumpling house that was next door was killer. delightful dumplings for mere $s.if we had been able to have a room with bed instead of , that would have been the only change we wanted. definitely book. jan a quiet place to stay... first of all we did have a hard time finding a taxi from the airport that would take us to the hotel because none of them knew where it was. we finally found a driver who was willing to try to find it and he called the hotel from his cell phone and took us directly to the hotel--no problem. the hotel is down a small alley lined with little stores and restaurants but is off a busy main street lined with restaurants and shops and lots of taxi's to take you where you wish to go. the subway is a short minute walk from the hotel and will take you around the city even cheaper and as fast as the taxi's. the hotel was beautiful and comfy. our room looked out over the gardens and the bed was very soft compared to other beds i have slept on in china. free internet was a plus also (computer in the room). we only ate at the hotels restaruant for breakfast (a nice blend of asian and western food) for about rmb. if you wish all the bells and whistles of a large hotel don't stay here--it's a small, quiet, friendly hotel that was a pleasure to return to each night. nov very pleased with our choice! we were just delighted with the bamboo garden hotel! the gardens are lovely and our room nicely decorated and comfortable. we enjoyed our stay very much. the food at the hotel restaurant was delicious. be forewarned, the first time you walk down the alleyway to the hotel you might think you've made a big mistake. you haven't! you will be very pleasantly surprised as to what awaits you.the ladies at the front desk are helpful and efficient, but not exactly warm or charming. perhaps just a cultural difference.it is close to the subway and just a little way to the south there is a terrific park with lakeside eating choices. wishing you a great time in beijing! oct memorable hotel we stayed in bamboo garden hotel during the beijing leg of our china tour primarily because we don't want generic looking hotels so much and we were not disappointed. it is located in the hotungs and not very &quot;famous&quot; with taxi drivers but they were always helpful and we were able to go back no problem with help of the hotel card. the staff were friendly and very helpful. simple service that feels genuine and none of those super trained star hotel types. we went together with our month old and yr old kids. the staff were very kind and entertained them while we are waiting for some reception confirmation, taxi etc. the rooms are ok, clean with huge firm beds. my baby didn't like the crib they provided though( too small) so she slept with us. the huge bed was great!my year old son loved the hotel so much. it's look, it's garden , with the blue birds and especially the red lanterns at night. until now he still talks about the bamboo hotel and asks us to go back :)for my husband the best part is the massage. really relaxing after a day of touring. the in room computer is also great as we didn't have room to bring our laptop with all the kiddie gear we had. there are several small eateries around but we didn't get to try them. the drumtower is also nearby and from the drumtower other places of interest are a stroll away. definitely a good location especially if you love walking or biking around. we did not walk so much though with kids in tow. but taxi was not hard to come by :) oct hello from lee i really enjoyed our stay in the bamboo garden hotel and on my next trip in january i will also be staying again. thank you very much for your kindness and the warm hospitality – especially the help with our visas! ciao and kisses from the children! sep perfect hotel oasis in beijing! like a beautiful bamboo oasis in the middle of urban beijing, the bamboo garden hotel is an authentic, beautiful and cozy place to hang your hat. the asian inspired rooms are full of comfortable chairs, couches and come equipped with a computer, flat screen tv and meticulously clean bathrooms. the mattresses are a bit hard, but the super soft bedding more than makes up for it. the grounds of the hotel are great to explore and have a couple quaint ivy covered courtyards, red lanterned walkways and mini ponds w/ koi.the breakfast buffet is yuan extra, but convenient and delicious! the front desk staff speak very good english and are very attentive. tours can be booked through the desk, and money can be changed as well. the location can't be beat - five minute walk to the subway (which is definitely the best way to get around town) ...and a minute walk to the hip part of town where all the trendy restuarants are popping up. we opted for the airport pick up &amp; the driver was right on time!i highly recommend the bamboo garden hotel.. enjoy! aug nice hotel in a nice area bamboo garden hotel is located - minutes to gulou subway station in a hutong. one can reach the bell and drum towers and the houhai lake in less than minutes walking. especially the lake is quiet nice with lots of shops, restaurants, public dancing and singing etc.the hotel is very quiet, there are some nice courtyards and lots of stuff to care about guests. our standard suite for app. rmb (close to the olympics) was very nice, large and clean. it was equipped with a large flat screen tv with lots of foreign channels and a computer with broadband internet. breakfast was very good but relatively pricey for rmb. small shops and a supermarket are around the corner.we especially enjoyed staying in a small hotel in a hutong area and not in a large chain-hotel, which seem to be located mostly at main roads with lots of traffic. aug hotel history i stayed at this hotel a long time ago but would highly reccomend it. i chose this hotel because i had just read &quot;claws of the dragon&quot; by john byron and john pack., a biography of kang sheng, a high level politburo member during the cultural revolution. if you are planing on staying here read this book for some facinating background aug a beijing getaway the best part of this hotel is that it's not in the hotel district; it's located in a residential area in an old part of the city, a walled district known as a huotang. also, most guests are independent travelers. we did not encounter any tour groups. the hotel restaurant is excellent and cheap. we had a semi-deluxe room, which was small but adequate. bathroom was fine, lots of hot water. the air conditioner was loud and it took the staff a day or two to get the temperature right. beds are hard as they are everywhere in china, but housekeeping put a quilt underneath the sheet for us. service is great even when you can't find anyone who speaks english. we booked by sending wendy an e-mail from the hotel website. she arranged our stay, and an excursion to the jinshanling part of the great wall for usd. do arrange for an airport pick-up, about $ to $ usd. it's more expensive than a cab but you won't risk the driver not knowing where the place is. the hotel is close to a subway stop on a line that will take you to all the sites. jul peaceful oasis i recently spent nights at the bamboo garden hotel with my husband and teenage son. the taxi driver struggled to find the hotel &amp; had to stop to get directions. as we searched for the hotel i was concerned as the area was run down and known as the hutongs. however, as soon as we arrived we knew we had found a hidden gem.the room was filled with authentic furniture and yet it had modern features. the hotel &amp; grounds were peaceful. we particularly enjoyed our visits to the tea room which had an underfloor fish pool. the staff were friendly and would not accept tips.we would definitely stay here again. may a great small hotel i couldn't agree more with greystones who took the words right out of my mouth. my wife and i also stayed there in april and the only thing i would add to greystones comments would be that the hotel courtyard was also beautiful with the cherry and apple blossom in full bloom. there are ponds and waterfalls with goldfish, however i must say i did feel a little sorry for the few goldfish in the &quot; font &quot;. a great little hotel and excellent value for money may a quiet oasis in a noisy city we stayed here for nights in april and found it a little oasis in a melee of noise, smells and sounds. we would certainly recommend this hotel.the staff were friendly and laughed at our attempts to try to say hello and thank you in chinese but did try to help with our pronunciations. the rooms were clean and decorated in traditional chinese style. the duvets were silk and were warm and comfortable. a tea tray was provided and all bathroom extras were there. the food was excellent when we stayed for dinner as were the breakfasts each morning. we did have to teach the girl behind the bar how to make gin and tonics! we took tea on the tea terrace where we were served tea by the boy with the 'long spouted kettle'.because it is in a hutong you have to pass the public toilet which can smell a bit but it all adds to the life of the city and one that might disappear quickly with the rate of new building in beijing. the hotel is bordered by a block of flats that overlooks the garden. may bamboo garden - perfect! family of four stayed at the bamboo garden hotel. we booked two rooms and both were clean, modern, and lovely. my son spoke some chinese and that was helpful with the hotel staff.we booked a driver through the hotel to pick us up at the airport - but he/she never arrived. fortunately, our son met us at the airport and we took a taxi to the hotel - for a lot less than we were quoted by the hotel website staff.the grounds were magical - after sightseeing, it was wonderful to sit on the patio and drink a beer among the blossoms.hotel staff was helpful, friendly and attentive. rooms had flat screen tv's and computers with internet access. each bathroom had soap, shampoo, toothbrushes, toothpaste among other things.the hotel was located down a hutong - with stores that sold food, beer, tea, etc. each room had a fridge to eat left over goodies from dinners.hotel was located near many places to eat - all of them wonderful - and most importantly - the hotel was only a few blocks from the subway - a great way to travel in beijing.i fully recommend this hotel. apr bamboo garden beijing a fantastic unconventional hotel fantastic experience. i frequently travel for business, but this time it was an holiday i took with my wife in china. in bamboo garden hotel we found nice and kind staff, english is spoken. western breakfast is available andthe internal restaurant is also good. the hotel was an old noble house of a former imperial minister. clean, quiet, nice with a wide garden and internal relaxing sight. the hotel is situated in the hutong area, and arriving by taxi, entering in the small street inside the hutongs, you could have some doubts about your booking...don't worry: the area is absolutely safe and secure, and entering in the hotel environment you think you are entering in a small paradise in a different time. there you can feel the real chinese life, living in a fantastic environment.this hotel is different than the usual buiness or travel hotels, and we spent our days in beijing in a non conventional excellent hotel. i recommended it to friends and, for sure, for my next time in beijing i will reserve again in bamboo garden. mar liked this hotel but problems getting a taxi there was a lot to like about the bamboo garden. lovely rooms, beautiful garden, great location in the hutongs with a lot of character. and free internet!the biggest drawback seemed to be getting back at the end of the day. we didn't have a car and driver while in beijing, so we had our guide write out the name of the hotel (with directions) in mandarin to give to a taxi driver. however, taxis didn't seem to want to drive to the hutongs, or to be clear on how to get there. one night we had four taxis refuse to drive us before we finally found one who would. and they never drove us down our hutong -- which i understand, as it was quite narrow -- but they never even dropped us off at the right one. fortunately, the first night we showed the directions to a local resident, who was able to point us in the right direction, and thereafter we memorized how to get there!the food at breakfast and the one dinner we ate there were average.although we liked many things about the hotel, i wouldn't stay there again unless i had a driver that i knew would take me back at the end of each day. feb perfect welcome to china the bamboo garden hotel was a wonderful oasis of calm in the hustle and bustle of beijing. i stayed here on my first trip to china, and i had wanted to stay someplace a little &quot;traditional&quot; and this ended up being the perfect choice. the courtyard and gardens are pretty, the facilities in general are nice, the restaurant is good (note the long-spouted tea kettles!), and while the rooms aren't luxurious per se, they are comfortable enough for the jetlagged body. i laughed when i read one negative review criticizing the hotel for not having marble floors, or soft fluffy towels, but give me a break ... this is china! if you want soft fluffy pillows stay at the grand hyatt--this is probably not the place for you. if you want a bit more of a traditional experience, and are a little more adventurous, stay here!a few other notes:- as others have commented, make sure you have cash on hand to pay for a taxi into town (the taxi is not associated with the hotel, so it can't just be added to your room fee) ... the airport has an atm, so i'd recommend using it before heading into town, but the hotel will also change money.- the hotel is located very close to a subway stop ... beijing's subway is a cheap, easy way to get around town.- make sure you have the hotel's name in chinese and a map in case you can't find your way back (but that applies to all hotels in china).- i have seen mixed reviews about the front desk staff ... personally the woman that helped us during our stay was very helpful in arranging activities like the beijing opera and transportation (we took a night train to xi'an from beijing). feb a very good choice. bamboo garden beijingan excellent choice. delightful buildings set in beautiful courtyards in a hutong. location excellent - two blocks to the metro which delivers one to the forbidden city. rooms excellent with a free computer. very good restuarant and plenty of cheaper ones with an easy walk. organised an excellent vehicle, driver and guide to visit the great wall. nov favorite hotel in china i just returned from a trip to china and have to say that my stay at the bamboo garden was my favorite. the neighborhood was safe and so interesting to wander around in. i t is just two blocks from the drum tower and a block from the subway station. the room was lovely and the gardens delightful. i enjoyed the restaurant very much. if you want a hotel with a true chinese feeling to it, this is the place. i can't say enough about the staff who were so helpful and friendly. i was a single woman and felt very safe at the hotel and in the area. communications with the hotel were promptly responded to and my request for a non smoking room was honored. oct the perfect getaway in beijing what a pleasure to spend the last evening of a two-week whirlwind trip around china on the grounds of this lovely, peaceful hutong hotel.our flight back into beijing arrived late at night, but hotel staff was there at the airport ready to receive us and whisk us away to the hotel. check-in was efficient, and bellhops were courteous and quiet. we were taken aback by the beauty of our room. we had asked for a room with a garden view. before our eyes were beds covered in lovely chinese-red comforters, beautiful traditional chinese furniture, our own computer with internet access, an immaculate bathroom, and windows opening to the garden. we spent a peaceful night and morning in the room and then enjoyed a short stroll across the grounds. far away is the chaos of beijing. you're in another world at this hotel. we enjoyed lunch at the hotel restaurant. tea served from a long-spouted pot, table positioned on top of the transparent floor through which we could see the green pond, courteous service, and delicious food: eight treasure tofu pot, bamboo shoots with mushrooms, sweet and sour pork, and beijing-style noodles. we loved this meal.we would go back again and again to stay at this hotel. in fact, it is on our list of places to revisit in china. sep nice origional hotel very good hotel for its three star rating. the staff is very friendly. the neighbourhood is not so exciting, but it's near the beihaipark, so you can walk to that. the room is beautifull and the garden even so. a pity is it, when it is raining you can not sit in the garden.you have free internet, but when your computer has a hardware error you can not use it. the have to repair it, but they didnot came. aug oasis of peace and gardens good location nice rooms bamboo garden has an authentic feel to it as soon as you step in, so we were surprised to find the flat screen tvs and in-room pc with fast internet access (which i'm now using to write this review).cons: room could be a bit cleaner (quite a lot of dust in ours), and the aircon doesn't really work that well. breakfast isn't a highlight and not really recommended.pros: rooms are full of character and comfortable, and it feels like you're staying in the real china (my perceived one, anyway). location is close to old beijing quarters and i'm pleased we didn't book one of the characterless tourist traps.the grounds and gardens are beautiful and peaceful. overall we felt it was good value, a good location and a nice environment. jul a secret joy like others we had a problem when the car &amp; driver we booked with the hotel to pick us up from the airport didn't show. &quot;problem&quot;, they said &quot;between the sales desk and reception.&quot;. hmmm. fortunately it was late at night and a government taxi from the domestic terminal only cost rmb - rmb less than what the hotel wanted. also, as we never found a taxi driver that spoke any english, we were dropped off at the wrong guesthouse on this little lane. (confusion over &quot;zhu yuan&quot; and &quot;ju yuan&quot;). so wandering down an unlit laneway at midnight, we were so very pleased to finally see the treasure hidden behind a tiny entrance gate. once in our room, it was fantastic. the rooms had recently been redone, and the view from our ground floor window was as if we were in a huge park or garden. no noise from nearby reconstruction reached inside (double glazing perhaps), and despite the ferocious summer heat, the room was always cool (maybe a touch too cool). our bed was very firm - the asian style - but i noticed a nagging back ache suddenly disappeared. very surprised to see the computer with internet provided free in the room, along with the flat screen lcd tv with cable. not many english channels, but we enough to find the weather and headlines. room rates were higher than expected - a recent rate hike i expect. at rmb we expected more of a suite, but we enjoyed it so much we didn't complain. the staff were helpful but only if asked. otherwise they would sit back and do other things until you were ready. we preferred this than always being bothered. any time we did ask, no matter how trivial or small they jumped to it. their english is barely passable, so a little chinese will always help. only had one breakfast in the restaurant ( rmb) which was a mixed buffet of asian and western (continental) plus a cook that would whip up eggs. the meal was certainly good, but we preferred the hutongs in the early morning where we could find pork buns for / jiao ( . rmb), and lovely spinach rolls ( jiao). it was certainly great to be right in there with them rather than the marble palaces in downtown. we bought beer (pi jiu) from the shop next door for or rmb and keep them in our fridge for our return after a hard day shopping in the heat! fabulous. occassionally splurged and had a beer on the restaurant terrace to sit and enjoy the garden and its lighting. got a simple but adequate haircut next door for only rmb. the hotel arranged our car and driver to the great wall at simitai - probably dearer than it should have been at around rmb, but we couldn't be bothered trying to bargain through the official tourist agencies. just told them the night before and it was there at am. finally, the main streets nearby are mildly interesting but not hugely westernised, so don't expect a wide choice of meals at pm. not a lot of shops, though the drum tower is very close, as is the subway and several bus routes. take a shortcut through the hutongs to get quickly to the hou lake for a bit more of the hectic bars &amp; cafes, tourist shops and wonderful scenery. overall, the bamboo garden was like a prize we loved to return to each day out. the serenity was a secret joy that restored and revitalised us our entire week stay. jul shaky start great hotel my first impressions of the hotel were not good - i'd booked the hotel's driver to collect me from the airport but was surprised to be asked at the hotel to pay the driver directly in cash rather than the cost being added to my hotel bill. i just had enough chinese money with me to pay the driver. the hotel website said they offered currency exchange services so i tried to change $nz but they wouldn't accept it, so &quot;limited currency exchange&quot; would have been more accurate - unless you have something like $us you're out of luck. the staff member i dealt with through this was not overly friendly or helpful.i had no problems from then on. the setting is great, very peaceful. i was shown to a lovely single room ( ) full of character, with a fabulous bathroom and free internet access; later i booked an additional night and got a double room ( ) which was just as good - no internet - but had a bit of drain smell in the bathroom - which as i later discovered you get in character hotels here as part of the package and is no problem if you close the bathroom door. the beds were the most comfortable of any i slept on during my trip.i ate a few dinners in the hotel restaurant and the food was ok - breakfast buffet just adequate - but also try the local street vendors and dumpling shops. restaurant staff spoke very little english. i didn't try their spa; if you go left out the main gate and explore the hutongs you'll find the blind massage place - awesome - mins walk. make the most of the fabulous location.most staff here speak limited english but are helpful. ask them to write down your destination in characters to show taxi drivers, and also ask them to write in characters the hotel name and driving directions to it, as taxi drivers can never find it.this hotel was excellent value for money and offered a good balance between character and comfort. jun great hidden gem we arrived in the evening and the street you drive down is a little ominous in the dark! we asked to see the room before signing in and had a pleasant suprise. the clerk had said the room was chinese style which put us on our guard. the rooms appear to be recently remodeled. it may be chinese style but has the western touch's of home. flat screen tv with some english speaking stations. a nice sitting area for tea on your own private veranda overlooking the courtyard. the view to the courtyard is reminisant of a mountain scene. the staff is very friendly and wants to please. the food is good and the breakfast is western style, while lunch and dinner has the chinese menu. this was a nice place to finish out our trip to china. &quot;aaa for the money&quot;! jun a taste of old beijing we stayed there for nights for a vacation. the best part about this hotel is its classic lush chinese garden. especially dining on the restaurant patio, which has a beautiful grapevine cover and a nice view of the garden. it's very relaxing to have a meal or a drink there. the hotel is not exactly comfortable, if you are used to the amenities and services of -star conference hotels. the bathroom is too small and they only provide couple very thin towels. the location is fairly good. it takes about - minutes to walk to the nearest subway station, which is absolutely faster and more efficient than taking a cab. most guests are older tourists that travel in groups. although the place is very much a novelty to foreign tourists that want a taste of old beijing, i don't think i'll choose there again. there are plenty of old beijing to see in the city while you are out during the day. i would rather come back to a hotel room that has comfortable bed, nice linen, and big marble bathrooms equipped with high quality shampoo and large, soft, fluffy towels....stuff bamboo garden does not provide. we booked a small suite with twin beds for $ rmb/night, but they just increased their rate this spring. the same suite would be more than $ , rmb. apr great place to stay hotel was brilliant. good location away from the real hussle and bussle of beijing but still close enough to get to everywhere easy enough.tube only a min walk away and good links to everywhere you want to go and if not taxis were always easy to hail down.room was nice and large and very comfortable with everything you could ask for and with a nice view over the garden. staff were really helpfull too. if you're after a trip to the great wall we booked ours throught the youth hostal just round the corner and couldn't fault it.make sure you have the hotel written in chinese symbols for when you first arrive as it is a little hard to find being in the middle of the hutongs.loved the hotel and love beijing. would stay again in an instant. mar perfect! couldn't be better! will go there next time for sure.excellent location (far better than the crowded and not interesting center of the city). flawless service (the staff helped us in every respect from arranging trips, maps &amp; directions, taxis, and even currency exchange at the bank rate)beautiful and consistently clean rooms (the traditional chinese decor make it a great experience).no need to look for any other hotel. this one is perfect.march rd jan a great escape! oh, the tea house! oh, the gardens! oh, the wild vines growing over the roof of the outdoor restaurant! we adored this place and will be staying there again when we return to china this august.we had been booked into the novotel peace hotel in beijing when we first arrived, because we were on an adoption trip and i was very paranoid about having a safe in the room (for cash, important papers etc.). well, after two days in a hotel that was fine enough, but could have been anywhere, we switched over to the bamboo garden. just driving down that long alleyway, past hutong where people were actually still living and working as in old times (so many of these are being torn down in favor of gleaming skyscrapers as olympics approach), you just felt like you were getting a taste of the real beijing. we had hired a guide who kept us running around like crazy all day, and when we got back to the bamboo garden, it was like weight literally flew from our shoulders and we were light again. i was able to put all my important stuff in the hotel safe behind the front desk, and all was well.if you don't stay at this hotel, definitely stay at one of the other hutong hotels. they are simply beautiful and magnificient. (the beds were twin, though, a la lucy and ricky, so be prepared for that!) oct great place to stay! we loved staying here on our vacation in october . its much more of an experience than staying at the bland western-style hotels in beijing. the best things about the place are the big, peaceful courtyard in the middle... the reception staff speak good english, the bar is really nice with a little waterfall in it with fish swimming around, and the location is great, mins walk from the subway station. i'd really recommend using the subway. its much less stress than having to deal with beijing's taxi drivers. on our vacation we had two bad experiences with taxi drivers who charged us times the proper price for the journey. after that we stuck to public transport and found it really easy.a few people have mentioned that the bamboo garden has hard beds. to be honest, we actually found them softer than a lot of the hotels we stayed at in china.there dont seem to be many travel websites where you can book rooms at this hotel, but we booked by just emailing them thru the address on their website. its standard policy for most chinese hotels to completely ignore any email enquiries they receive, but i found the bamboo garden respond to enquiries really quickly during their office hours.if i go back to beijing i'd definately stay at the bamboo garden again. oct lots of character in a nice location i stayed at the bamboo garden in early september for nights. i was looking for a place with some character vs the usual -star properties, and bamboo garden fit the bill. my room was one of the standard suite rooms, with a front room containing chinese-style furniture and a tv, and a bedroom with large (and somewhat hard) bed, new tv, and the a/c unit. the bedroom faced the front alley but was very quiet. the bathroom was small but functional and clean. there were a few issues but they didn't bother me. your response may vary. the front room isn't the kind of place you'd want to sit and relax as the furniture is a little too severe. some of the plaster on the walls near the bathroom was a little soft and showing signs of moisture damage. the hard bed would have been a concern if i had stayed longer, but i took sleeping pills the first few nights to help get over jet lag and really didn't notice.the best aspect of the hotel is its location in a beijing hutong on the north side of the city. it is a - minute walk south of the gulou subway station, down an alley off the main street. it is an old-style courtyard building, with some rooms in a newer-looking building on the inner courtyard (i didn't see these). since it is not a -star hotel the prices for breakfast, internet access, laundry, etc. are not unreasonable. the location means you are have lots of options. i ate several times at a dumpling place just down the alley from the hotel. they have an english menu probably because they are used to tourists from the hotel eating there, but mostly i saw chinese eating there. there is a youth hostel a -minute walk south on the main street which has -yuan per hour internet access and relatively inexpensive tours on offer. another minutes or so south is the houhai lake area with loads of restaurants, bars, and a few historic sights. i had a delightful day just walking around the hutongs and lakes. being on the north side of beijing it is relatively easy to get out to the summer palace and great wall. taxis are cheap but traffic can make it difficult at times to reach other areas so i usually took the subway to get close and then a taxi the rest of the way.if i return to beijing as a tourist i would stay here again. for a business trip, especially if my destination was the cbd over to the east, i would probably pick a -star property closer to my destination instead. aug wouldn't stay there again jul simply delightful jun great sanctuary jun nice garden jan peaceful; decent for the price nov we loved this hotel jul bamboo garden for traveler (not for tourist) apr great hotel not so great location apr traditional nov a neat bamboo garden questionable location jan ???????????? nov el precio que pone es una estafa jul un trésor dec nice property we booked a three bedroom room for $ /nite, each room came with a queen size bed. also included was a kitchen with frig and microwave, and a washer dryer. there was also a dining area and living room, where we could sit down at night and go over all the booty collected in a days shopping. while the rooms were very spartan and lacked color, the room was very clean. the location is great and i would highly recommend this hotel to everyone, except leon helmsley, who would probably prefer the astoria. sep great hotel for large groups! (and individuals...) i traveled to beijing in june with friends and we needed an inexpensive hotel that would hold our large group. the century towers beijing hotel was perfect. we made a reservation through www.sinohotel.com, which i was nervous about at first, not being familiar with them. the customer service reps were fantastic, responding to all my spastic e-mails quickly and with great care. when we arrived at the hotel, we breezed through check-in and were given the same price quoted on sinohotel.com so there were no $$ issues. we stayed in a -bedroom apartment-style space (the &quot;large&quot; version offered on the website), with full bathrooms (american standard fixtures) a full kitchen, and a dining room. it even included a washer/dryer in the unit, though we didn't have any need to use it. the apartment was very clean, air-conditioned, and spacious, even with the of us, we had plenty of room to relax! the hotel is across the street from a huge supermarket, so we ended up cooking most breakfasts in the room, saving even more money! we kept lots of cold bottled water in the fridge to take with us on our adventures in the hot, dry summer weather of beijing. the room included a large flat-screen tv in the living room with cable, and a few english-language channels like the bbc (and the simpsons!)other really nice aspects of the hotel include a work-out room in the basement with treadmills, stationary bikes, a rowing machine, ballet bar, free weights, and weight machines. the hotel restaurant is very small but serves good food. the wait staff (and most of china) speak very little english, so learn basic chinese phrases and expec to smile and point a lot :) we are traveling to shanghai in the summer of and if century towers has a location there, we would absolutely stay again! i think the price is much cheaper at this hotel because it's a chinese hotel, not a foreign chain. we paid about $ usd/night for this large bedroom apartment-style room. between the of us, the price was certainly right! nov disappointed the hotel is out of the city centre, about minutes walk to t square. none of the taxi drivers i had knew where the hotel was - i had to show them on the map and at least had to stop to ask for directions. the staff were not especially friendly or organised. the staff in the restaurant were not at all welcoming to solo travellers. for nights i was sandwiched between a group of schoolgirls who spent their nights running up and down the corridor sqealing. the hotel shop is vastly overpriced - there is a grocery shop just down the road which is a lot cheaper. i'm sure there are better hotels in beijing for the same price. \""
